[[expected]]
== Planned Future Changes

* With the release of `/api/v2` of the API, v1 has been deprecated. Version 2 introduced changes in the GraphQL API only. See the note in the changelog for link:#v0.35.0[v0.35.0] for details. The `/api/v1` still works like before, we will however cease support for `/api/v1` in the future. The Java REST client still uses v1 per default but can be set to v2. We advise to do so while `/api/v1` is still supported to prevent failures in the future.

* The `html` field type will be removed in the future. Instead the `string` type will be used in combination with an additional configuration property for this field in the schema. Of course, your existing schemas will be migrated for you.

* The support for the embedded Elasticsearch will be dropped in the future. It is highly recommended to link:{{< relref "elasticsearch.asciidoc" >}}#_dedicated_elasticsearch[setup Elasticsearch as a dedicated service].

* The Mesh Server will require Java 11 with the release of 2.0.0. The runtime support for Java 8 will be dropped. The Mesh Java REST client will still be usable with Java 8.

[[v1.4.3]]
== 1.4.3 (TBD)

icon:plus[] Graph: It is now possible to configure a transaction commit timeout. The `storage.txCommitTimeout` or `MESH_GRAPH_TX_COMMIT_TIMEOUT` environment setting can be used to configure the timeout in milliseconds. By default no timeout will be applied.

icon:plus[] GraphQL: It is now possible to use paging arguments when loading nodes via the `NodeContent#referencedBy` field.

icon:plus[] Clustering: The `cluster.topologyLockTimeout` setting has been added. When set to a value greater than 0 a write lock will be applied to prevent write requests during cluster topology changes.

icon:check[] Clustering: The default value for the `vertxPort` setting has been changed to `4848`.

icon:plus[] Clustering: The coordinator layer feature has been added. The layer can be enabled to efficiently process REST requests in a multi-master and master-replica cluster setup.

More information can be found in the link:{{< relref "clustering.asciidoc" >}}#_coordination[Cluster coordination section].

icon:plus[] REST: The `/admin/shutdown` endpoint has been added. This allows users with admin privileges to shutdown the mesh process.

icon:plus[] REST: It is now possible to read and update the cluster configuration in runtime via the `/api/v2/admin/cluster/config` endpoint.

icon:check[] Docker: An issue with the docker building process has been fixed which caused an unnecessary layer to be added to the docker image.

[[v1.4.2]]
== 1.4.2 (24.02.2020)

icon:check[] UI: The Gentics Mesh UI has been updated to version link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh-ui/blob/1.1.1/CHANGELOG.md#111---2020-02-19[1.1.1]

icon:check[] Core: The storage filesystem compatibility check has been made more reliable.

icon:check[] Core: Fixed a bug that caused errors during microschema migrations in certain situations.

[[v1.4.1]]
== 1.4.1 (19.01.2020)

icon:plus[] Core: The core Vert.x library was updated to version `3.8.5`.

icon:check[] OrientDB: The included OrientDB version has been updated to version `3.0.28`

icon:check[] Core: The handler for webroot updates is now running in a worker thread. This will prevent "Thread blocked" messages in the log.

icon:check[] Core: The debuginfo endpoint now correctly includes the `default-distributed-db-config.json` file.

[[v1.4.0]]
== 1.4.0 (24.01.2020)

icon:plus[] Security: User client certificate handling has been added to the Mesh Server.

The following settings have been added:

  * `server.sslPort` (Env: `MESH_HTTPS_PORT`) - SSL Port (Default: **8443**)
  * `server.http` (Env: `MESH_HTTP_ENABLE`) - Flag to enable http server (Default: **true**)
  * `server.clientAuthMode` (Env: `MESH_HTTP_SSL_CLIENT_AUTH_MODE`) - Authentication mode to control how client certificates should be handled. (Default: **none**)
  * `server.trustedCertPaths` (Env: `MESH_HTTP_SSL_TRUSTED_CERTS`) - List of certificates which will be trusted by the server.

The Gentics Mesh HTTPs server supports three client authentication modes:

* `none` - Reject client certificates during SSL handshake (**default**)
* `request` - Request client certificate. A client certificate will be used when provided. The request will also work when omitting the client cert.
* `require` - Requiring a client certificate. The ssl handshake will fail when no client certificate was provided.

More information can be found in the link:{{< relref "references.asciidoc" >}}#_https[HTTPs server section].

icon:plus[] Java Rest Client: The client configuration has been enhanced. It is now possible to specify a client certificate and key to be used by the REST client.

The following methods have been added to the config builder for `MeshRestClientConfig`:  

Methods to set the client key which will be used during SSL handshake:

  * `MeshRestClientConfig.Builder#setClientKey(String path)`
  * `MeshRestClientConfig.Builder#setClientKey(InputStream ins)` 
  * `MeshRestClientConfig.Builder#setClientKey(byte[] data)` 

Methods to set the client certificate which will be used during SSL handshake:

  * `MeshRestClientConfig.Builder#setClientCert(String path)`
  * `MeshRestClientConfig.Builder#setClientCert(InputStream ins)`
  * `MeshRestClientConfig.Builder#setClientCert(byte[] data)`

Methods to add one or more trusted CAs for the client:

  * `MeshRestClientConfig.Builder#addTrustedCA(String path)`
  * `MeshRestClientConfig.Builder#addTrustedCA(InputStream ins)`
  * `MeshRestClientConfig.Builder#addTrustedCA(byte[] data)`

Method to set the hostname verification checks:

  * `MeshRestClientConfig.Builder#setHostnameVerification(boolean flag)`

icon:plus[] Storage: Gentics Mesh will now automatically detect storage filesystem capabilities and enable or disable DirectIO features accordingly.

icon:check[] Core: Improved REST API startup performance. Fixes link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh/issues/996[#996]

icon:plus[] Docker: The Gentics Mesh demo docker container has been updated:

  * Additional group permissions will be set to the application folders to allow root group to access and write into those.
  * The pre-extracted embedded Elasticsearch folder has been removed from the server image to reduce the docker image size. The embedded ES will automatically be extracted to the `/mesh/elasticsearch` folder when embedded mode is enabled.
  * The JRE version in the docker image has been updated from version `11.0.3_7` to `11.0.5_10`.

[[v1.3.3]]
== 1.3.3 (17.01.2020)

icon:check[] Core: Fixed a bug in the link renderer that caused the language parameter to be ignored if the branch parameter was passed.

icon:check[] Core: The maximum transaction batch size when purging versions is now link:{{< relref "administration-guide.asciidoc" >}}#_general_settings[configurable]. Lowering the value from its default (10) will cause the version purge to take more time, but use less memory.

icon:plus[] Docker: The Gentics Mesh server docker container has been updated:

  * Additional group permissions will be set to the application folders to allow root group to access and write into those.
  * It is now possible to run the container with any uid. The user for the specified UID will automatically be created. This change enhances OpenShift support for the docker containers.
  * The pre-extracted embedded Elasticsearch folder has been removed from the server image to reduce the docker image size. The embedded ES will automatically be extracted to the `/mesh/elasticsearch` folder when embedded mode is enabled.
  * The JRE version in the docker image has been updated from version `11.0.3_7` to `11.0.5_10`.

[[v1.3.2]]
== 1.3.2 (12.12.2019)

icon:check[] Fixed a bug in the `{project}/nodes/{node}` endpoint that allowed nodes to be found even if the requested node is not part of the project.

icon:check[] Fixed a bug that caused errors if an entity was requested by UUID and that UUID was from an entity of another type.

icon:plus[] Security: A dedicated logger for security related actions has been added. This logger always adds the IP address and username of the client. You can configure the logger in the `logback.xml` using the name `SecurityLogger`.

[[v1.3.1]]
== 1.3.1 (09.12.2019)

icon:check[] Tests: The `MeshDockerServer` and `MeshLocalServer` testcontainer classes will now set the initial admin password and not use a random generated password.

icon:check[] Java Rest Client: The client will now set the default max requests per host limit to `64` instead of `5` to improve concurrent request handling.

[[v1.3.0]]
== 1.3.0 (05.12.2019)

icon:plus[] Core: The amount of the deployed REST API verticles can now be link:{{< relref "administration-guide.asciidoc" >}}#_httpsssl[configured] and its default has been changed from 5 to 2 * CPU Cores.

icon:plus[] Core: It is now possible to use Gentics Mesh in read only mode. Take a look at the link:{{< relref "administration-guide.asciidoc" >}}#readonly[documentation] for more information.

icon:check[] REST: The `/health/live` and `/health/ready` endpoints have been added to the REST API. These endpoints are also available on the monitoring server, but adding them to the REST server makes it possible for load balancers to monitor the server on the same port that used to proxy the requests.

icon:check[] REST: The link:https://getmesh.io/docs/api/#users__userUuid__token_post[`/user/:uuid/token`] endpoint now has the Cache-Control header set to private.

icon:check[] Java Rest Client: Fixed a bug that caused `MeshOkHttpRequestImpl#getResponse` to always return null.

icon:plus[] Core: The core Vert.x library was updated to version `3.8.4`.

icon:plus[] Core: The core plugin framework library was updated to version `2.1.0`.

icon:check[] OrientDB: The included OrientDB version has been updated to version `3.0.25`

icon:plus[] Security: Build artifacts for Gentics Mesh will now be cryptographically signed using GPG.

icon:check[] Core: Some no longer needed dependencies were removed.

icon:plus[] Security: The initial admin password that is created during setup will now be randomized and it is required to enter a new password on the first login. The `MESH_INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variable can be used to set a custom initial password. The password reset rule can be disabled via the `MESH_INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD_FORCE_RESET` environment variable.

[[v1.2.1]]
== 1.2.1 (22.11.2019)

icon:check[] Core: Mesh now uses a different parser for processing `.docx` and `.pptx` files. Parsing these files will now require far less memory.

icon:check[] GraphQL: Fixed fetching node references from users. link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh/issues/393[#393] link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh/issues/934[#934]

icon:check[] Java Rest Client: Fixed a bug that some generic methods would not allow response objects of any class.


[[v1.2.0]]
== 1.2.0 (20.11.2019)

WARNING: The internal database structure has changed significantly to avoid vertices with many edges. This will result in a higher write performance on bigger systems. For this change, the API of Gentics Mesh did not change at all. When starting with this version on an existing database, the structure changes will be applied automatically, which will take some time to complete.

CAUTION: If you are running Gentics Mesh in cluster mode, you need to link:{{< relref "clustering.asciidoc" >}}#_setup[initialize the cluster again]. You must use the `-initCluster` command line argument or set the `MESH_CLUSTER_INIT` to `true` on one of the master instances of the cluster.

icon:check[] Java Rest Client: Generic methods (`get`, `post`, `put`, `delete`) now allow response objects of any class.

icon:check[] UI: The UI has been updated to version link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh-ui/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md#110---2019-11-20[1.1.0].

[[v1.1.1]]
== 1.1.1 (11.11.2019)

icon:plus[] GraphQL: The GraphQL Endpoint now supports the `wait` query-parameter like the Search Endpoint does. link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh/issues/805[#805]

icon:plus[] Clustering: The role of an instance has been added to the link:https://getmesh.io/docs/api/#admin_cluster_status_get[cluster status response].

icon:plus[] Plugins: It is now possible to specify the API Version that should be used when creating a new admin client. link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh-incubator/issues/216[#216]

icon:check[] Core: Some optimizations to uploading binaries have been made.

icon:check[] Core: Fixed an issues that sometimes caused errors when performing write requests during a schema migration.

icon:check[] UI: The UI has been updated to version link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh-ui/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md#102---2019-11-11[1.0.2].

[[v1.1.0]]
== 1.1.0 (29.10.2019)

WARNING: The internal monitoring library has been changed from dropwizard to link:https://micrometer.io/[micrometer]. This allows better labeling of various metrics for link:https://prometheus.io/[Prometheus]. With this change, some metrics names from Vert.x have been changed. See link:https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-micrometer-metrics/java/#_vert_x_core_tools_metrics[here] for the new list of Vert.x metrics. By default, JVM metrics are also recorded. This can be configured in the link:{{< relref "administration-guide.asciidoc" >}}#_monitoring_options[monitoring options]. Also, the response structure in the `/search/status` endpoint has changed. Take a look at the link:https://getmesh.io/docs/api/#search_status_get[API docs] for a new example.

icon:plus[] Search: A new setting has been added which can be used to enable Elasticsearch 7 support. The `search.complianceMode` setting in the `mesh.yml` file can be used to control the compliance mode for Elasticsearch support. The setting can also be controlled via the `MESH_ELASTICSEARCH_COMPLIANCE_MODE` environment variable. Currently there are two modes: `ES_7` for Elasticsearch 7.x and `ES_6` for Elasticsearch 6.x.
By default `ES_6` will be used thus no changes are required for existing installations.

icon:plus[] Core: A new endpoint for administration has been added. The `/admin/debuginfo` endpoint lets you gain various informations about the system. Take a look at the link:{{< relref "administration-guide.asciidoc" >}}#debuginfo[administration guide] for details.

icon:plus[] Monitoring: New metrics for caching statistics have been added. Take a look at the link:{{< relref "monitoring.asciidoc" >}}#metrics[documentation] for the new metrics.

icon:check[] OrientDB: The included OrientDB version has been updated to version 3.0.24

icon:check[] Core: Some extensive logging messages will now only be logged on a finer log level. These include error messages for GraphQL queries, on closed client connections and requests sent to Elasticsearch.

[[v1.0.2]]
== 1.0.2 (11.10.2019)

icon:check[] Core: The internal memory usage has been reduced.

[[v1.0.1]]
== 1.0.1 (08.10.2019)

icon:check[] UI: The UI has been updated to version link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh-ui/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md#101---2019-10-08[1.0.1]

icon:plus[] Core: Link resolving now supports branches. Take a look at the link:{{< relref "features.asciidoc" >}}#linkresolvingbranches[documentation] for more information. link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh-incubator/issues/38[#38]

[[v1.0.0]]
== 1.0.0 (03.10.2019)

icon:bullhorn[] New UI

[quote]
____

This version of Gentics Mesh contains the a new UI which is accessible via `/mesh-ui`. The old UI is still part of this release and can be accessed via `/mesh-ui-v1`.

The following noteworthy aspects of the UI have been updated / altered:

* The permission management has been reworked
* The new schema editor which features autocompletion
* The usability of the edit view has been enhanced
* The editor for HTML fields has been replaced
* A new image editor has been added which now supports focal point handling
* Language handling has been improved
* The UI no longer depends on Elasticsearch
____

icon:bullhorn[] New defaults

[quote]
____

For new server installations (`mesh-server`) the Elasticsearch embedded server will no longer be enabled by default. The demo server (`mesh-demo`) will still start the embedded Elasticsearch server for ease of use.
It is still possible to enable the embedded server via the `search.startEmbedded: true` and `search.url: http://localhost:9200` settings in the `mesh.yml` file.
____


icon:check[] Search: Synchronizing the search index when starting after Gentics Mesh has not been stopped properly will not block the startup routine anymore. link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh/issues/862[#862]

icon:check[] Core: Path resolving performance has been increased.

[[v0.41.0]]
== 0.41.0 (01.10.2019)

icon:plus[] REST: The ETag generation was reworked. This means that previously generated ETags are no longer valid.

icon:check[] REST: Fixed ETag generation when `fields` or `rolePerms` was used. Previously these parameters did not affect the ETag. link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh/issues/881[#881]

CAUTION: Reworked OAuth2 / OIDC support

[quote]
____

The `security.oauth2` configuration section was removed. Instead the `security.publicKeysPath` property was added.

In order to provide support for more authentication providers it is now possible to specify the path to a file which contains the public keys in the configuration. These keys will be used to validate the access tokens.

You can read more about how to setup OAuth2 / OIDC in the link:{{< relref "authentication.asciidoc" >}}#_oauth2_oidc[OAuth2 / OIDC] guide.

It is now also possible for Authentication Service Plugins to provide Json Web Keys (JWK) to Gentics Mesh. Plugins can load the accepted JWK's from the authentication provider server and return it to Gentics Mesh. A plugin has to implement the `getPublicKeys()` method to support this.

Plugins can now implement the `extractUsername()` method to return the username that should be used to handle mappings between Mesh and JWT.

Please note that installations which already use an authentication plugin can either update the plugin and provide the public keys or manually add the public key to the `public-keys.json` configuration file.
____


[[v0.40.3]]
== 0.40.3 (13.09.2019)

icon:plus[] Java Rest Client: Various new methods have been added to handle endpoint agnostic requests (`get(), post(), delete(), put()`). These methods can be used to handle plugin requests.

icon:check[] Migration: It is now possible to apply schema / microschema changes that include the `name` property via the `changes` endpoint. Previously the name property was not utilized.

[[v0.40.2]]
== 0.40.2 (09.09.2019)

icon:plus[] Core: It is now possible to configure the transaction retry limit using the `MESH_GRAPH_TX_RETRY_LIMIT` environment variable or the `storage.txRetryLimit` parameter.

icon:check[] Core: The default value for `storage.synchronizeWrites` has been changed to `true`.

icon:check[] Core: The default value for the OrientDB parameter `tx.retry.delay` has been increased to 10ms, and the constant delay will be used instead of growing linearly. It is now possible to configure the delay via the `MESH_GRAPH_TX_RETRY_DELAY` environment variable.

icon:check[] Config: It is now possible to override the mapping mode with the `MESH_ELASTICSEARCH_MAPPING_MODE` environment variable. link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh/issues/878[#878]

[[v0.40.1]]
== 0.40.1 (06.09.2019)

CAUTION: REST: When updating permissions to an element, unset permissions in the request will not change these permissions anymore. Previously, unset permission were set to false.

icon:check[] Core: Various handlers were blocking the event loop when run. This has been fixed now.

icon:check[] Core: Fixed delayed initialization of `VersionPurgeJobImpl` vertices. Previously the type was not setup during start up and this resulted in a warning when the type was first used.

icon:plus[] Java Rest Client: The `createSchema()` methods now accept a `ParameterProvider` vararg parameter.

icon:check[] Core: Schema validation will no longer fail by default, when Elasticsearch is not available. The previous behavior can be enforced by adding `?strictValidation=true`.

icon:check[] GraphQL: Fixed a bug that prevented loading of permissions of an element.

icon:plus[] GraphQL: Added the `rolePerms` field to mesh elements. This allows you to load permissions of a role, similar to the link:{{< relref "features.asciidoc" >}}#_querying_permissions[`?role` query parameter in REST].

[[v0.40.0]]
== 0.40.0 (27.08.2019)

icon:bullhorn[] Image Manipulation: The new resizing options `smart`, `prop` and `force` have been added.

[quote]
____

**force**

The `?resize=force` mode will resize the image to the specified dimensions. This can lead to a distorted image when the aspect ratio of the source image does not match the destination aspect ratio.

**smart**

When using `?resize=smart` the resizer will automatically crop the image to the desired dimensions instead of distorting it when providing `width` _and_ `height` parameters which would result in an aspect ratio that is different from the original images aspect ratio.

The new default image resize mode is `smart` which potentially crops an image when requested aspect ratio that diverge from the source images aspectratio. The old behaviour can now be achieved by using the `?resize=force` parameter.

**prop**

The `?resize=prop` mode will resize the image proportionally so that the resulting destination format fits inside the provided dimensions (`width`, `height`). No distortion of the image will occur.

For details on image manipulation and resizing opions read the link:{{< relref "image-manipulation.asciidoc" >}}[Image Manipulation documentation].

This change might not automatically apply when an image is already in the cache. To make sure that the changes take effect, the cache in `data/binaryImageCache/` must be manually cleared.

____

icon:plus[] Search: A new search option `search.mappingMode` has been added. The mapping mode setting influences how mappings for fields will be generated. By default the mode `DYNAMIC` is used. In this mode mappings are generated as before. When using the mode `STRICT` only mappings for fields which have a custom mapping via the `elasticsearch` schema parameter will be created. This is useful if you want to have finer control of what contents should be added to Elasticsearch.

icon:plus[] Graph: The default value for `tx.retry.delay` has been set to 0. The tx delay will thus be disabled by default.

icon:plus[] Clustering: The `storage.synchronizeWrites` option will be enabled by default when clustering is active.

icon:plus[] OrientDB: The included OrientDB version has been updated to version 3.0.23

[[v0.39.2]]
== 0.39.2 (20.08.2019)

icon:check[] A regression in `v0.38.0` caused migration errors for nodes which contained not yet populated fields. This issue has now been fixed. Failed migrations can be re-run by deleting the failed job via `DELETE /api/v2/admin/jobs/{jobUuid}` and triggering `POST /api/v2/{project}/branches/{branchUuid}/migrateSchemas` to create a new migration job. link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh/issues/847[#847]

icon:plus[] Graph: It is now possible to configure the OrientDB transaction delay by adding the `tx.retry.delay` parameter to the the `storage.parameters` field.

[[v0.39.1]]
== 0.39.1 (14.08.2019)

icon:check[] A regression in `v0.39.0` broke the `/demo` endpoint. This has been fixed now and the demo application is accessible again.

[[v0.39.0]]
== 0.39.0 (13.08.2019)

icon:plus[] Core: The core has been reworked to add future support for multitenancy in Gentics Mesh.

[[v0.38.1]]
== 0.38.1 (12.08.2019)

icon:check[] Plugins: A bug in the plugin startup process has been fixed. Previously plugins were not initialized prior to registration.

icon:check[] GraphQL: The `pluginApi` field will no longer be added to the schema if no GraphQL plugins have been deployed to avoid schema validation errors. link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh/issues/842[#842]

icon:plus[] Changelog: The `ReleaseBranchRenameChange` entry has been updated to reduce required memory and increase execution performance on large databases (2m+ nodes).

icon:plus[] REST: A `X-Powered-By` header was added to all http responses.

[[v0.38.0]]
== 0.38.0 (09.08.2019)

CAUTION: Removal of mapper script support

[quote]
____

The mapper script support has been dropped due to the deprecation of the Nashorn JavaScript engine. The functionality of mapper scripts can be replaced by usage of the new link:{{< relref "plugin-types/auth-service-plugin.asciidoc" >}}[Authentication Service Plugin API].

The `auth.mapperScriptDevMode` and `auth.mapperScriptPath` configuration options are no longer needed and have been removed.
____

icon:check[]: Plugins: The query type of plugins will now automatically be prefixed with the plugin apiName to ensure that no type conflicts can occur.

[[v0.37.1]]
== 0.37.1 (06.08.2019)

icon:plus[] Core: The core Dagger library was updated from version `2.11` to `2.24`.

icon:plus[] Logging: Additional activity information will be logged when the logger for class `io.vertx.core.eventbus.EventBus` is set to level `DEBUG`.

[[v0.37.0]]
== 0.37.0 (05.08.2019)

icon:bullhorn[] New Plugin System

[quote]
____

The Plugin System has been overhauled.

*REST API changes*

Previously plugins were assigned a UUID and could thus be managed using this uuid:

* `DELETE /admin/plugins/{uuid}`

The new plugin system will now utilize the plugin id for these REST and GraphQL API instead. The pluginId is unique to each plugin and a better and easier to grasp identifier for a plugin.

*New Java API / Structure*

The plugin API and structure has been overhauled and existing plugins need to be migrated (link:{{< relref "plugin-migration.asciidoc" >}}[Migration Guide]) to the new API in order to be deployable.

*GraphQL Plugin support*

It is now possible to create plugins which extend the GraphQL API. Plugins which provide link:{{< relref "plugin-development.asciidoc" >}}#_graphql_plugin[GraphQL extensions] will be made accessible under the `pluginApi` GraphQL field.

*Dropped maven repository support*

It is no longer possible to load plugins directly via Maven Coordinates. The REST API will only accept a filesystem paths to plugins.

*Classloader fix*

The classloader mechanism has been altered.  Plugins can now provide their own library versions. Previously a class which was also present in Gentics Mesh Server was loaded from the server class loader instead of the plugin. This has been fixed now.

*Examples / Guide*

The plugin development process documentation has been enhanced.

* link:{{< relref "plugin-development" >}}[Plugin Development]
* link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh-plugin-examples[Plugin Examples]
* link:{{< relref "guides/mesh-library-plugin" >}}[Example Plugin Guide]

____

icon:check[] Core: Fixed a bug that caused an error when changing a field in a schema to a binary field.

icon:plus[] REST: A core library for JSON support (jackson) has been updated.

icon:plus[] Core: The core Vert.x library was updated to version `3.8.0`.

[[v0.36.8]]
== 0.36.8 (02.08.2019)

icon:check[] Core: Fixed a bug that caused node contents to not be found when migrating from an old version of Gentics Mesh (0.22.x) to the current version.

[[v0.36.7]]
== 0.36.7 (23.07.2019)

icon:check[] Backup: Fixed a bug in the backup handler which prevented the backup process to switch back to the correct status after a backup failed due to filesystem errors.

icon:plus[] Java Rest Client: Added `#equals` and `#hashCode` implementations to REST models.

icon:plus[] Graph: It is now possible to configure the OrientDB `RID_BAG_EMBEDDED_TO_SBTREEBONSAI_THRESHOLD` setting by adding the `ridBag.embeddedToSbtreeBonsaiThreshold` parameter to the the `storage.parameters` field.

icon:plus[] REST: An error will now be returned when sending the `newPassword` field in the login request when the `forcedPasswordChange` flag has not been set.

icon:plus[] REST: The webroot responses will now contain the header `Webroot-Node-Uuid` which identifies the node of the loaded content.

icon:plus[] REST: The authentication and element loading performance has been greatly increased.

[[v0.36.6]]
== 0.36.6 (16.07.2019)

icon:plus[] REST: The performance of path resolving has been improved.

icon:plus[] Core: A new configuration section has been added. The `cache` options in the `mesh.yml` can now be used to control cache settings. The `cache.pathCacheSize` config setting and `MESH_CACHE_PATH_SIZE` environment variable can be used to control the path cache which will improve webroot and GraphQL path resolving performance.

icon:plus[] REST: The `webroot` endpoint will now set the `Cache-Control` header to `public` if the requested node can be read using the anonymous role. Otherwise the header will be set to `private`. This information is useful if you want to use a Caching Proxy in-between Gentics Mesh and your front-end application.

icon:check[] Core: Performance of loading nodes has been improved.

CAUTION: Java Rest Client

[quote]
____

The default field values for `NodeResponse` and `AbstractGenericRestResponse` has been updated.

The following values have been changed:

* `AbstractGenericRestResponse#permissions`
* `NodeResponse#tags`
* `NodeResponse#childrenInfo`
* `NodeResponse#container`
* `NodeResponse#fields`
* `NodeResponse#breadcrumb`

The `NodeResponse#isContainer` method has been deprecated and was replaced by `NodeResponse#getContainer`

Applications which use affected models will most likely not need to updated since the returned response will always set the affected fields.
____

icon:plus[] REST: The `?fields` query parameter which can be used to filter response properties will now work more granularly on node responses.

CAUTION: Custom node migration scripts have been removed.

[quote]
____

The script system was a source of possible errors and performance problems. Also, the nashorn javascript engine has been deprecated with the release of Java 11. If you need to change data for a migration, use the REST Api instead.
____

icon:check[] REST: Fixed a bug that sometimes caused a wrong image to be sent to the client when using image manipulation. link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh/issues/669[#669]

icon:plus[] REST: Error messages now contain the property `i18nKey`. This allows for easy identification of different errors.

[[v0.35.0]]
== 0.35.0 (06.06.2019)

CAUTION: Rest Model: The `BranchResponse#isMigrated` method has been changed to `BranchResponse#getMigrated`.

NOTE: Fetching fields of a node/micronode in GraphQL requires a different query in `/api/v2`. Please refer to the link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh/issues/428[#428] and link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh/issues/317[#317] for details.

icon:check[] Backup: Fixed `NullPointerException` which occurred when the backup directory was missing and the backup endpoint was invoked. link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh/issues/463[#463]

icon:plus[] Core: The core Vert.x library was updated to version `3.7.1`.

icon:check[] Focal point: It is now possible to use the `{apiLatest}/:projectName/nodes/:uuid/binaryTransform/:fieldName` to resize and image and set the focal point in one operation.

icon:bullhorn[] Versioning Enhancements

[quote]
____

The versioning system has received various enhancements.

link:{{< relref "features.asciidoc" >}}#auto-purge[Auto Purge]

The auto purge feature will now automatically purge the previously no longer needed version of a content. You can control this behaviour using the `autoPurge` flag in the `mesh.yml` file.

Additionally schema's may now contain a `autoPurge` flag to override the setting on a per schema basis.

The documentation contains detailed information about how versioning can be controlled.

link:{{< relref "features.asciidoc" >}}#_listing_versions[Listing Versions]

Versions of a node can now be listed via REST and GraphQL.

link:{{< relref "features.asciidoc" >}}#_purging_versions[Purging Versions]

Versions can now be purged across projects to reduce disk storage usage.
____

icon:check[] Java Rest Client: Fixed a bug that prevented automatic reconnection to the eventbus when it did not succeed immediately.

icon:check[] Upload: The document processing library _tika_ has been updated to version `1.21` to fix potential out of memory issues during upload document processing.

icon:check[] Branch Migration: A bug in the branch migration process has been fixed. Previously the wrong version of the content was used as branch root version. The process will now utilize the published version if one exists and otherwise use the draft version. This fix only affected internal data handling.

[[v0.33.1]]
== 0.33.1 (23.05.2019)

icon:check[] Core: The dependency _hazelcast-kubernetes_ has set to version 1.2.2 to fix a compatibility issue with the used hazelcast version.

[[v0.33.0]]
== 0.33.0 (20.05.2019)

icon:bullhorn[] Elasticsearch document handling

[quote]
____

The support for the Elasticsearch ingest plugin has been removed. The same functionality has been replaced with a much more efficient implementation which extracts the plain text of a document during upload processing. The structure of the generated search index has not changed and thus no modifications on existing search queries is required.

The plain text will now also be included in the REST and GraphQL response of binary fields.

An automatic changelog entry has been added which will parse all uploaded documents and extract the plain text. The duration of the execution of this task depends on the amount of documents that need to be parsed.

The new __mesh.yml__ setting `upload.parserLimit` can be used to control the document parser. See link:{{< relref "features.asciidoc" >}}#_text_extraction[Text extraction documentation] for more information.
____

icon:plus[] Search: The embedded elastichead interface has been removed. It is recommended to use browser extentions like link:https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/elasticsearch-head/ffmkiejjmecolpfloofpjologoblkegm[ElasticSearch Head for Chrome] instead.

icon:check[] Core: Various internal libraries have been updated (logback, hazelcast-kubernetes, tika)

icon:plus[] OrientDB: The included OrientDB version has been updated to version 3.0.19

[[v0.32.0]]
== 0.32.0 (08.05.2019)

icon:bullhorn[] Event Handling

[quote]
____

The event handling mechanism has been completely overhauled.

*Changes*

* Additional events have been added
* Event payload includes more information
* Java Models for events have been added

*API*

The API class `com.gentics.mesh.MeshEvent` was replaced by `com.gentics.mesh.core.rest.MeshEvent`.

____

icon:bullhorn[] Elasticsearch Handling

[quote]
____

The Elasticsearch integration has been overhauled.

*Integration*

Elasticsearch synchronization operations have been decoupled from regular write operations.

This has two main effects. First, regular write operations (e.g. Node Update, Node Create) will not block until the changed data has been synchronized with elasticsearch. This will result in higher overall write performance. Secondly, changes will not be directly visible in Elasticsearch since write operations in Elasticsearch have been decoupled and will be executed asynchronously after a element in Gentics Mesh has been modified. Implementations which highly rely on Gentics Mesh being in sync with ES for each operation may need to be adapted. When using the `/search` or `/rawSearch` endpoints in mesh, you can now provide the `?wait=true` query parameter. See details link:{{< relref "elasticsearch.asciidoc" >}}#endpoints[here]

*Fixes*

Various issues with the previous Elasticsearch synchronization mechanism have been addressed.

* Deletion of nodes will now also update documents in the index which reference the deleted node
* Tag and Tag Family deletion will now correctly update referenced tags, tag families and nodes

*Startup*

Gentics Mesh will no longer wait for Elasticsearch during start-up.

*Resilience*

The resilience for Elasticsearch server issues has been improved. Failed requests will automatically be retried. If too many issues occur Gentics Mesh will automatically invoke an index sync in order to recover from the issue. This sync will be retried until Elasticsearch becomes responsive again.

*Syncing*

The clear and sync mechanism has been streamlined in order to benefit from other changes like resilience.

____

NOTE: It is not required to reindex documents since the index names and structure has not been changed.

icon:check[] File Handling: The file upload mechanism has been overhauled to address issues with blocked uploads which could occur when uploading multiple files in-parallel.

icon:check[] File Handling: Failed Uploads will now remove temporary files from disk. Previously in some error situations the temporary upload have not been removed.

icon:check[] Permissions: Applying permissions recursively on projects did not affect branches. This has been fixed.

icon:plus[] Permissions: Setting permissions recursively is now done more efficiently.

icon:plus[] Thread Usage: The overall request handling has been refactored to reduce situations in which the event-loop threads could be blocked. The request handling code has been unified.

icon:plus[] Core: The core Vert.x library was updated to version 3.7.0

icon:plus[] Performance: The overall read performance has been improved. The memory usage has been reduced.

[[v0.31.6]]
== 0.31.6 (27.05.2018)

icon:check[] Java Rest Client: Fixed a bug that prevented automatic reconnection to the eventbus when it did not succeed immediately.

[[v0.31.5]]
== 0.31.5 (07.05.2019)

icon:check[] REST: The `publish` and `readPublished` permissions are now only shown for nodes.

icon:check[] Core: Creation of schemas with the same name of an existing microschema or vice versa is not allowed anymore. Doing so caused conflicts in GraphQL. link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh/issues/597[#597]

icon:check[] Core: A bug in the image transform endpoint has been fixed. Previously nodes which were updated using that endpoint could not be found via webroot anymore. link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh/issues/599[#599]

icon:plus[] Job: The endpoint `POST {apiLatest}/admin/jobs/:jobUuid/process` has been added. It can be used to trigger job processing. The endpoint will also automatically reset a failed job to be queued again. The endpoints `DELETE {apiLatest}/admin/jobs/:jobUuid/error` and `POST {apiLatest}/admin/processJobs` will be removed in a future release. link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh/issues/171[#171]

icon:check[] Plugins: A `NullPointerException` has been fixed which has happened when accessing `rc.user().principal()` within a plugin. link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh/issues/516[#516]

icon:check[] UI: Fixed validation issues in microschema lists when updating nodes. Previously validation issues would not be detected by the UI and the node update would fail. link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh-ui/pull/202[#202]

[[v0.31.4]]
== 0.31.4 (11.04.2019)

icon:check[] Schema: The `container` flag in the schema update request is now optional. Omitting the value will no longer cause Gentics Mesh to use the default value `false`. Subsequently the java request model was altered. The `Schema#isContainer` method was replaced with `Schema#getContainer`. Older REST client versions which by default always specified the container flag are still compatible with this change. link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh/issues/165[#165]

icon:check[] GraphQL: The permission check for the `nodes` field of the type `Tag` has been fixed. Previously loading tagged nodes for a tag did not return the expected result. The `published` permission for published nodes was not checked correctly. This has been fixed now.

icon:plus[] Logging:  The default `logback.xml` file has been updated to include automatic scan of the logging configuration. This change will not be applied to existing configurations.

icon:check[] Schema: It is now possible to reset the `allow` property of string fields. Setting the `allow` to empty array will now no longer restrict the values. Instead it will revert back to the original behaviour and allow all values.

icon:check[] UI: Fixed a bug that caused the node list to jump to the first page on various actions. link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh-ui/issues/195[#195]

[[v0.31.3]]
== 0.31.3 (28.03.2019)

icon:plus[] Logging: The conflict error logging has been improved. Conflict error information in the log will now be more detailed and also include the conflicting field key and versions.

icon:check[] Permissions: A bug in the GraphQL `nodes` field was fixed. Previously branches were not correctly handled and too many nodes would be returned. Additionally the field would not correctly handle the read published permission and also return draft nodes to which no read permission was granted.

[[v0.31.2.1]]
== 0.31.2.1 (23.08.2019)

icon:plus[] Logging: Additional activity information will be logged when the logger for class `io.vertx.core.eventbus.EventBus` is set to level `DEBUG`.

icon:check[] REST: Fixed a bug which prevented the `DELETE /api/v1/admin/jobs/:jobUuid/error` from resetting the job.

[[v0.31.2]]
== 0.31.2 (22.03.2019)

icon:plus[] Docker: Default memory settings for the server and demo docker images were updated. The `-Dstorage.diskCache.bufferSize=256` setting has been added for the server image. The setting can be changed using the `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS` environment variable. See link:https://getmesh.io/docs/administration-guide/#_memory_settings[Memory documentation] for more information and recommendations.

icon:plus[] OrientDB: The included OrientDB version has been updated to version 3.0.18.

icon:check[] REST: The `GET {apiLatest}/:projectName/nodes/:nodeUuid/binary/:fieldName` endpoint will now always include the `accept-ranges: bytes` header to indicate to the client that it supports range requests. link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh/issues/643[#643]

icon:check[] Configuration: The elasticsearch bulk limit can now be configured using the `MESH_ELASTICSEARCH_BULK_LIMIT` environment variable.

icon:check[] Permissions: A bug in the GraphQL permission handling has been fixed. Previously nodes which had only read published permission assigned to them were not returned using the `nodes` field.

icon:check[] Permissions: A bug in the permission handling of the nav root endpoint has been fixed. Previously nodes which had only read published permission assigned to them were not included in the navigation response.

[[v0.31.1]]
== 0.31.1 (18.03.2019)

icon:plus[] GraphDB Import/Export: The endpoints `POST {apiLatest}/admin/graphdb/export` and `POST {apiLatest}/admin/graphdb/import` have been added.

[[v0.31.0]]
== 0.31.0 (13.03.2019)

icon:bullhorn[] Monitoring

[quote]
____
This version of Gentics Mesh introduces the __Monitoring feature__.

The Gentics Mesh server will now *additionally* to port `8080` also bind to port `8081` in order to provide the new monitoring API. New configuration settings have been added to allow configuration of this server.

NOTE: The monitoring API should not be exposed publicly and will by default only bind to `localhost`.

A detailed description of this feature can be found in our link:{{< relref "monitoring.asciidoc" >}}[Monitoring Documentation].
____

CAUTION: In a future release the following endpoints will be removed from the regular API (Port 8080) since they were moved to the new  monitoring server API (Port 8081).

* `GET {apiLatest}/admin/status` (Server Status)
* `GET {apiLatest}/admin/cluster/status` (Cluster Status)

CAUTION: Because of a change in the image resizer, the change below might not apply when an image is already in the cache. To make sure that the changes take effect, the cache in `data/binaryImageCache/` must be cleared.

icon:plus[] Image: Quality of manipulated JPEG images can now be configured. The default value has been changed from `0.7` to `0.95`.

icon:plus[] Image: The filter for resizing images can now be configured. The default filter is Lanczos.

CAUTION: Java Rest Client: The Gentics Mesh Java REST client which was based on Vert.x was replaced with a `OkHttpClient` implementation. Some changes to the client interface were necessary to make the client independent of Vert.x. See link:https://getmesh.io/docs/platforms/#_java[this example] and the Javadoc for more information.

icon:check[] Clustering: The mesh version will no longer be appended  to the node name used for OrientDB clustering. It is recommended to sanitize the `data/graphdb/storage/distributed-db-config.json` file and remove/rename entries which reference older mesh nodes. Only the active nodes should be listed in the file.

icon:check[] Core: Fixed a bug that caused too long responses on binary range requests.

icon:check[] GraphQL: Fixed a bug when loading a node via path. When the node itself did not exist, the query would return its parent node.

icon:plus[] Demo: The link:https://demo.getmesh.io/demo[demo application] was updated to use Angular 5.

icon:plus[] Core: Gentics Mesh can now be downgraded if the link:{{< relref "administration-guide.asciidoc" >}}#database-revisions[database revision] matches the needed revision of Gentics Mesh.

icon:plus[] Clustering: Gentics Mesh is now able to form cluster between different server versions.
			A database revision hash will now be used to determine which versions of Gentics Mesh can form a cluster.
			Only instances with the same database revision hash are allowed to form a cluster.
			The current revision hash info is included in the `{apiLatest}` endpoint response.

icon:plus[] Various settings can now be overridden via link:{{< relref "administration-guide.asciidoc" >}}#_environment_variables[environment variables]. This is useful when dealing with docker based deployments.

icon:check[] Elasticsearch: Search requests failed on systems with many schemas. link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh/issues/303[#303]

icon:check[] Elasticsearch: Fixed handling of `search.url` settings which contained a https URL.

icon:check[] Image: The focal point resize returned a slightly skewed image when using the `fpz` zoom factor. link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh/issues/272[#272]

icon:check[] Events: The `mesh.node.deleted` event was not handled correctly. This has been fixed now.

icon:check[] Core: It was possible to upload binaries with empty filenames. This has been fixed now: it is enforced that
				  a binary upload has a filename and content type which are not empty. link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh/issues/299[#299]

icon:check[] Core: If the keystore path was only a file name without a directory a NPE was thrown on start-up. This has been fixed now.

icon:check[] Core: After resetting a job via rest (admin/jobs/::uuid::/error) the job was not processed again.
                  This has been fixed now. link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh/issues/295[#295]

icon:check[] Core: When the migration for multiple nodes failed during a schema migration the error details could become very long.
					This has been fixed now. Error details in the job list will be truncated after a certain amount of characters.

icon:check[] Core: Image transformation calls previously did not copy the image properties of the binary field.
                   Instead the filename and other properties were not copied to the new binary image field. This has been fixed now.

icon:plus[] REST: It is now possible use custom `HttpClientOptions` upon instantiation of a `MeshRestHttpClient`.

icon:check[] REST: The node response ETag now incorporates the uuids of all node references.

[[v0.15.0]]
== 0.15.0 (31.01.2018)

CAUTION: The embedded Elasticsearch was removed and replaced by a connector to a dedicated Elasticsearch server. It is highly recommended to verify existing queries due to breaking changes between Elasticsearch version 2.4 and 6.1.
Please also check the Elasticsearch changelog: link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/release-notes-6.1.0.html[Elasticsearch Changelog]

CAUTION: Configuration: The `mesh.yml` format has been updated. Please remove the `search` section or replace it with the following settings.

[source,json]
----
search:
  hosts:
  - hostname: "localhost"
    port: 9200
    protocol: "http"
  startEmbeddedES: true
----

CAUTION: The Elasticsearch update may affect custom mappings within your schemas. You may need to manually update your schemas.

Elasticsearch 6.1 compliant example for the commonly used raw field:

[source,json]
----
{
    "fields": {
        "raw": {
            "type": "keyword",
            "index": true
        }
    }
}
----

CAUTION: The `unfilteredCount` GraphQL paging property has been removed. You can now use the `totalCount` property instead.

CAUTION: Gentics Mesh will automatically extract and start an embedded Elasticsearch server into the `elasticsearch` folder. The old search index (e.g: `data/searchIndex`) can be removed.

CAUTION: The user which is used to run the process within the docker image has been changed. You may need to update your data volume ownership to uid/gid 1000.

icon:check[] Core: Fixed a deadlock situation which could occur when handling more than 20 image resize requests in parallel. Image resize operations will now utilize a dedicated thread pool.

icon:check[] Core: Fixed a bug which caused permission inconsistencies when deleting a group from the system.

icon:plus[] REST: Added support to automatically handle the `Expect: 100-Continue` header. We however recommend to only use this header for upload requests.
Using this header will otherwise reduce the response times of your requests. Note that PHP curl will add this header by default.
You can read more about the link:https://support.urbanairship.com/hc/en-us/articles/213492003--Expect-100-Continue-Issues-and-Risks[header here].

[[v0.14.0]]
== 0.14.0 (16.01.2018)

CAUTION: The image manipulation query parameters `cropx`, `cropy`, `croph` and `cropw` have been replaced by the `rect` parameter. The `rect` parameter contains the needed values `rect=x,y,w,h`.

CAUTION: The image manipulation query parameter `width` was renamed to `w`. The parameter `height` was renamed to `h`.

CAUTION: The binary transformation request request was updated. The crop parameters are now nested within the `cropRect` object.

CAUTION: It is now required to specify the crop mode when cropping an image. Possible crop modes are `rect` which will utilize the specified crop area or `fp` which will utilize the focal point information in order to crop the image.

icon:plus[] Image: It is now possible to specify a focal point within the binary field of an image.
                   This focal point can be used to automatically crop the image in a way so that the focused area is kept in the image.
                   The focal point can also be manually specified when requesting an image.
                   This will overrule any previously stored focal point information within the binary field.

CAUTION: Elasticsearch: Search queries will now automatically be wrapped in a boolean query in order to check permissions much more efficiently.

CAUTION: The schema field property `searchIndex` / `searchIndex.addRaw` has been removed. The property was replaced by a mapping definition which can be added to each field.
         All schemas will automatically be migrated to the new format. Please keep in mind to also update any existing schema files which you may have stored externally.

```json
{
  "name": "dummySchema",
  "displayField": "name",
  "fields": [
    {
      "name": "name",

        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

icon:plus[] Schema: It is now possible to configure index settings and custom search index field mappings within the schema.

The index settings can be used to define new link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-analyzers.html[analyzers] and link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-tokenizers.html[tokenizer] or other additional link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/_index_settings.html[index settings].
The specified settings will automatically be merged with a default set of settings.

Once a new analyzer has been defined it can be referenced by custom field mappings which can now be added to each field.
The specified field mapping will be added to the generated fields property of the mapping. You can read more about this topic in the link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/multi-fields.html[fields mapping documentation] of Elasticsearch.

        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

You can use the `POST {apiLatest}/utilities/validateSchema` endpoint to validate and inspect the effective index configuration.

icon:plus[] REST: The `POST {apiLatest}/utilities/validateSchema` and `POST {apiLatest}/utilities/validateMicroschema` endpoints can now be used to validate a schema/microschema JSON without actually storing it.
                     The validation response will also contain the generated Elasticsearch index configuration.

icon:plus[] GraphQL: Nodes can now be loaded in the context of a schema. This will return all nodes which use the schema.

icon:plus[] Search: The `{apiLatest}/rawSearch/..` and `{apiLatest}/:projectName/rawSearch/..` endpoints have been added. These can be used to invoke search requests which will return the raw elasticsearch response JSON.
                       The needed indices will automatically be selected in order to only return the type specific documents. Read permissions on the document will also be automatically checked.

icon:plus[] Search: Error information for failed Elasticsearch queries will now be added to the response.

icon:plus[] Webroot: The schema property `urlFields` can now used to specify fields which contain webroot paths.
                     The webroot endpoint in turn will first try to find a node which specified the requested path.
                     If no path could be found using the urlField values the regular segment path will be used to locate the node.
                     This feature can be used to set custom urls or short urls for your nodes.

icon:check[] Performance: Optimized binary download memory usage.

icon:check[] REST: Fixed a bug which prevented pages with more than 2000 items from being loaded.

icon:check[] Search: The `raw` field will no longer be added by default to the search index. Instead it can be added using the new `searchIndex.addRaw` flag within the schema field.
             Please note that the raw field value in the search index will be automatically truncated to a size of 32KB. Otherwise the value can't be added to search index.

icon:check[] Migration: Interrupted migrations will now automatically be started again after the server has been started. Failed migration jobs can be purged or reset via the `{apiLatest}/admin/jobs` endpoint.

icon:check[] Migration: Migrations will no longer fail if a required field was added. The field will be created and no value will be set. Custom migration scripts can still be used to add a custom default value during migration.

icon:plus[] Clustering: This release introduces the master-master clustering support. You can read more about clustering and the configuration in the link:{{< relref "clustering.asciidoc" >}}[clustering documentation].

icon:plus[] Core: The OrientDB graph database was updated to version 2.2.26

icon:plus[] REST: The `{apiLatest}/admin/consistency/check` endpoint has been added. The endpoint can be used to verify the database integrity.

icon:check[] Core: Fixed missing OrientDB roles and users for some older graph databases. Some graph databases did not create the needed OrientDB user and roles. These roles and users are needed for the OrientDB server and are different from Gentics Mesh users and roles.

icon:check[] REST: Invalid date strings were not correctly handled. An error will now be thrown if a date string can't be parsed.

icon:check[] REST: The delete handling has been updated.
                   It is now possible to specify the `?recursive=true` parameter to recursively delete nodes.
                   By default `?recursive=false` will be used. Deleting a node which contains children will thus cause an error.
                   The behaviour of node language deletion has been updated as well. Deleting the last language of a node will also remove this node. This removal will again fail if no `?recursive=true` query parameter has been added.

== 0.9.28 (28.08.2017)

icon:check[] Core: The permission check system has been updated. The elements which have only `readPublished` permission can now also be read if the user has only `read` permission. The `read` permission automatically also grants `readPublished`.

icon:check[] Java REST Client: The classes `NodeResponse` and `MicronodeField` now correctly implement the interface `FieldContainer`.

icon:check[] REST: The endpoint `{apiLatest}/{projectName}/nodes/{nodeUuid}/binary/{fieldName}` did not correctly handle the read published nodes permission. This has been fixed now. link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh/issues/111[#111]

== 0.9.27 (23.08.2017)

icon:plus[] GraphQL: It is now possible to retrieve the unfiltered result count. This count is directly loaded from the search provider and may not match up with the exact filtered count.
            The advantage of this value is that it can be retrieved very fast.

icon:plus[] Java REST Client: The client now also supports encrypted connections.

icon:check[] REST: Invalid date were not correctly handled. An error will now be thrown if a date string can't be parsed.

icon:check[] GraphQL: Various errors which occurred when loading a schema of a node via GraphQL have been fixed now.

== 0.9.26 (10.08.2017)

icon:plus[] UI: Added CORS support. Previously CORS was not supported by the UI.

icon:check[] REST API: Added a missing allowed CORS headers which were needed to use the Gentics Mesh UI in a CORS environment.

icon:check[] UI: Fixed translation action. Previously a error prevented translations from being executed.

icon:check[] UI: Fixed image handling for binary fields. Previously only the default language image was displayed in the edit view. This has been fixed.

== 0.9.25 (09.08.2017)

icon:plus[] Demo: The demo dump extraction will now also work if an empty data exists. This is useful when providing a docker mount for the demo data.

icon:plus[] GraphQL: The paging performance has been improved.

icon:plus[] Core: Various missing permission checks have been added.

icon:check[] Core: A bug in the schema changes apply code has been fixed. The bug previously prevented schema changes from being applied.

== 0.9.24 (03.08.2017)

icon:plus[] REST API: Added idempotency checks for various endpoints to prevent execution of superfluous operations. (E.g: Assign role to group, Assign schema to project)

icon:check[] Core: Fixed a bug which prevented micronodes from being transformed. SUP-4751

== 0.9.23 (02.08.2017)

icon:plus[] Rest-Client: It is now possible to configure the base uri for the rest client.

icon:plus[] GraphQL: It is now possible to get the reference of all projects from schemas and microschemas.

icon:check[] UI: Date fields now work with ISO 8601 strings rather than Unix timestamps.

icon:check[] UI: Fixed bugs with lists of microschemas. (SUP-4712)

icon:check[] UI: Fixed mouse clicks not working in lists in FF and (partially) in IE/Edge. (SUP-4717)

icon:plus[] Core: The OrientDB graph database was updated to version 2.2.24

icon:check[] Core: Fixed handling of ISO8601 dates which did not contain UTC flag or time offset value. Such dates could previously not be stored. Note that ISO8601 UTC dates will always be returned.

icon:check[] GraphQL: URL handling of the GraphQL browser has been improved. Previously very long queries lead to very long query parameters which could not be handled correctly. The query browser will now use the anchor part of the URL to store the query.

icon:check[] Migration: The error handling within the schema migration code has been improved.

icon:plus[] GraphQL: It is now possible to load the schema version of a node using the ```schema``` field.

icon:check[] Versioning: Older Gentics Mesh instances (>0.8.x) were lacking some draft information. This information has been added now.

== 0.9.20 (21.07.2017)

icon:plus[] License: The license was changed to Apache License 2.0

icon:plus[] Schema Versions: The schema version field type was changed from `number` to `string`. It is now also possible to load schema and microschema versions using the `?version` query parameter.

icon:check[] Search: The error reporting for failing queries has been improved.

icon:plus[] Schemas: The default content and folder schemas have been updated. The `fileName` and `folderName` fields have been renamed to `slug`. The `name` field was removed from the content schema and a `teaser` field has been added.
These changes are optional and thus not automatically applied to existing installations.

icon:plus[] Demo: The `folderName` and `fileName` fields have been renamed to `slug`. This change only affects new demo installations.


icon:check[] GraphQL: The language fallback handling was overhauled. The default language will no longer be automatically be append to the list of fallback languages. This means that loading nodes will only return nodes in those languages which have been specified by the `lang` argument.

icon:check[] GraphQL: The `path` handling for nodes within node lists has been fixed. Previously it was not possible to retrieve the `path` and various other fields for those nodes.

== 0.9.9 (19.05.2017)

icon:plus[] Core: The OrientDB graph database was updated to version 2.2.20.

icon:plus[] API: The following endpoints were moved:

 * `{apiLatest}/admin/backup`  ⟶  `{apiLatest}/admin/graphdb/backup`
 * `{apiLatest}/admin/export`  ⟶  `{apiLatest}/admin/graphdb/export`
 * `{apiLatest}/admin/import`  ⟶  `{apiLatest}/admin/graphdb/import`
 * `{apiLatest}/admin/restore` ⟶  `{apiLatest}/admin/graphdb/restore`

icon:plus[] Core: Added `{apiLatest}/:projectName/releases/:releaseUuid/migrateMicroschemas` endpoint which can be used to resume previously unfinished micronode migrations.

icon:plus[] Performance: The startup performance has been increased when dealing with huge datasets.

icon:plus[] Auth: The anonymous authentication mechanism can now also be disabled by setting the `Anonymous-Authentication: disable` header. This is useful for client applications which don't need or want anonymous authentication. The Gentics Mesh REST client has been enhanced accordingly.

icon:plus[] Core: The read performance of node lists has been improved.

icon:plus[] Core: The write performance of nodes has been improved.

icon:plus[] Demo: The demo data have been updated. The a folderName and fileName field has been added to the demo schemas.

icon:plus[] Core: The OrientDB graph database was updated to version 2.2.19.

== 0.9.7 (28.04.2017)

icon:plus[] GraphQL: The nested `content` and `contents` fields have been removed. The properties of those fields have been merged with the `node` / `nodes` field.

icon:plus[] GraphQL: The field names for paged resultset meta data have been updated to better match up with the REST API fields.

icon:plus[] GraphQL: A language can now be specified when loading node reference fields using the `lang` argument.

icon:plus[] GraphQL: It is now possible to resolve links within loaded fields using the `linkType` field argument.

icon:plus[] Auth: Support for anonymous access has been added to mesh. Requests which do not provide a `mesh.token` will automatically try to use the `anonymous` user. This user is identified by `username` and the thus no anonymous access support is provided if the user can't be located.

icon:plus[] GraphQL: It is now possible to retrieve the path for a content using the `path` field. The `Node.languagePaths` has been removed in favour of this new field.

icon:plus[] Auth: It is now possible to issue API tokens via the `GET {apiLatest}/users/:userUuid/token` endpoint. API tokens do not expire and work in conjunction with the regular JWT authentication mechanism. These tokens should only be used when SSL is enabled. The `DELETE {apiLatest}/users/:userUuid/token` endpoint can be used to revoke the issued API token. Only one API token is supported for one user. Generating a new API token will invalidate the previously issued token.

icon:check[] GraphQL: An error was fixed which occurred when loading a node using a bogus uuid.

icon:check[] Auth: An error which caused the keystore loading process to fail was fixed.

== 0.9.6 (14.04.2017)

icon:plus[] It is now possible to resume previously aborted schema migrations via the `{apiLatest}/:projectName/releases/:releaseUuid/migrateSchemas` endpoint.

icon:plus[] Auth: The Java keystore file will now automatically be created if none could be found. The keystore password will be taken from the `mesh.yml` file or randomly generated and stored in the config.

icon:check[] Core: Migration errors will no longer cause a migration to be aborted. The migration will continue and log the errors. An incomplete migration can be resumed later on.

icon:check[] Core: Fixed node migration search index handling. Previous migrations did not correctly update the index. A automatic reindex will be invoked during startup.

== 0.9.5 (13.04.2017)

icon:plus[] Java: The Java model classes have been updated to provide fluent API's.

icon:plus[] Demo: It is now possible to access elasticsearch head UI directly from mesh via http://localhost:8080/elastichead - The UI will only be provided if the elasticsearch http ports are enabled. Only enable this for development since mesh will not protect the Elasticsearch HTTP server.

icon:plus[] Core: Downgrade and upgrade checks have been added. It is no longer possible to run Gentics Mesh using a dump which contains data which was touched by a newer mesh version. Upgrading a snapshot version of Gentics Mesh to a release version can be performed under advisement.

icon:check[] A NullPointerException within the Java Rest Client was fixed.

icon:check[] The AngularJS Demo was updated.

== 0.9.0 (27.03.2017)

icon:plus[] Gentics Mesh now supports GraphQL.

icon:important[] The `expandAll` and `expand` parameters will be removed within an upcoming release of Gentics Mesh. We highly recommend to use the GraphQL endpoint instead if you want to fetch deeply nested data.

icon:plus[] Schema name validation - Schema and microschema names must only contain letter, number or underscore characters.

icon:plus[] Node Tag Endpoint

The endpoint `{apiLatest}/:projectName/nodes/:nodeUuid/tags` was enhanced. It is now possible to post a list of tag references which will be applied to the node. Tags which are not part of the list will removed from the node. Tags which do not exist will be created. Please note that tag families will not automatically be created.

The `tags` field within the node response was updated accordingly.

== 0.8.3 (24.02.2017)

icon:plus[] Tags are now also indexed in the node document in the field `tagFamilies`, grouped by tag families.

== 0.8.2 (23.02.2017)

icon:check[] A bug which prevented index creation in certain cases was fixed.

== 0.8.0 (10.02.2017)

icon:plus[] Names, string fields and html field values will now be indexed using the https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/ngrams-compound-words.html[trigram analyzer].

icon:plus[] Binary Endpoint Overhaul

The field API endpoint `{apiLatest}/:projectName/nodes/:nodeUuid/languages/:language/fields/:field` was removed and replaced by the binary `{apiLatest}/:projectName/nodes/:nodeUuid/binary` endpoint.
The binary endpoints are now also versioning aware and handle conflict detection. It is thus required to add the `language` and `version` form data parameters to the upload request.

icon:plus[] Transform Endpoint Overhaul

The endpoint `{apiLatest}/:projectName/nodes/:nodeUuid/languages/:language/fields/:field/transform` was renamed to `{apiLatest}/:projectName/nodes/:nodeUuid/binaryTransform`.
The transform endpoint will now return the updated node.

icon:plus[] The no longer needed schemaReference property was removed from node update requests.

icon:plus[] The rootNodeUuid property within node project response was changed.

icon:bullhorn[] Versioning support

[quote]
____
This version of Gentics Mesh introduces versioning of contents. A detailed description of the versioning feature can be found in our https://getmesh.io/docs[Documentation].

Important changes summary:

* Node update request must now include the version information
* The query parameter `?version=published` must be used to load published nodes. Otherwise the node will not be found because the default version scope is __draft__.
* Two additional permissions for nodes have been added: __publish__, __readpublished__

Existing databases will automatically be migrated during the first setup.
____

icon:plus[] The missing *availableLanguages* and *defaultLanguage* parameters have been added to the *mesh-ui-config.js* file. Previously no language was configured which removed the option to translate contents.

icon:plus[] Image Property Support - The binary field will now automatically contain properties for image *width*, image *height* and the main *dominant color* in the image.

icon:plus[] API Version endpoint -  It is now possible to load the mesh version information via a `GET` request to `{apiLatest}/`.

icon:plus[] Project endpoint - The current project information can now be loaded via a `GET` request to `{apiLatest}/:projectName`.
