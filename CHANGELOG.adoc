* __[Feature]__ Versioning support

[quote]
____
This version of Gentics Mesh introduces versioning of contents. A detailed description of the versioning feature can be found in our [Documentation](http://getmesh.io/docs/beta/index.html).

Important changes summary:

* Node update request must now include the version information
* The query parameter `?version=published` must be used to load published nodes. Otherwise the node will not be found because the default version scope is __draft__.
* Two additional permissions for nodes have been added: __publish__, __readpublished__

Existing databases will automatically be migrated during the first setup.
____

* __[Enhancement]__ The missing *availableLanguages* and *defaultLanguage* parameters have been added to the *mesh-ui-config.js* file. Previously no language was configured which removed the option to translate contents.

* __[Enhancement]__ Image Property Support - The binary field will not automatically contain properties for image *width*, image *height* and the main *dominant color* in the image.

* __[Enhancement]__ API Version endpoint -  It is now possible to load the mesh version information via a `GET` request to `/api/v1/`.

* __[Enhancement]__ Project endpoint - The current project information can now be loaded via a `GET` request to `/api/v1/:projectName`.

* __[Bugfix]__ When the search indices where recreated with the reindex endpoint, the mapping for the raw fields was not added. This has been fixed now.

* __[Bugfix]__ The search index mapping of fields of type "list" were incorrect and have been fixed now.

* __[Bugfix]__ Various issues with the schema node migration process have been fixed.

== 0.6.26 (05.10.2016)

== 0.6.24 (19.09.2016)

* __[Enhancement]__ The Gentics Mesh admin ui has been updated. The UI will no longer send basic auth information for succeeding requests which were invoked after the login action had been invoked. Instead the basic auth login information will only be send directly during login.

* __[Bugfix]__ A bug within the breadcrumb resolver has been fixed. Previouly breadcrumbs did not account for language fallback options and thus returned a 404 path for nodes which used a different language compared to the language of the retrieved node. This has been fixed.

== 0.6.23 (14.09.2016)

* __[Bugfix]__ The missing availableLanguages and defaultLanguage parameters have been added to the mesh-ui-config.js file. Previously no language was configured which removed the option to translate contents.

* __[Enhancement]__ The performance of the search endpoints have been improved.

== 0.6.17 (22.06.2016)

* __[Bugfix]__ The path property within the node response breadcrumb was not set. The property will contain the resolved webroot path for the breadcrumb element. No value will be set if the resolveLinks query parameter was configured or set to OFF. CL-459
