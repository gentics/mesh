[[expected]]
== Planned Future Changes

* With the release of `/api/v2` of the API, v1 has been deprecated. Version 2 introduced changes in the GraphQL API only. See the note in the changelog for link:#v0.35.0[v0.35.0] for details. The `/api/v1` still works like before, we will however cease support for `/api/v1` in the future. The Java REST client still uses v1 per default but can be set to v2. We advise to do so while `/api/v1` is still supported to prevent failures in the future.

* The `html` field type will be **removed** in the future. Instead the `string` should be used in combination with an additional configuration property for this field in the schema.

* The support for the embedded Elasticsearch will be dropped in the future. It is highly recommended to link:{{< relref 
"elasticsearch.asciidoc" >}}#_dedicated_elasticsearch[setup Elasticsearch as a dedicated service].

[[v0.36.1]]
== 0.36.1 (TBD)

icon:check[] REST: The deletion of microschemas which contain changes has been fixed. Previously a `NotImplementedException` was thrown for microschemas which contained changes. link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh/issues/589[#589]

icon:check[] REST: Error messages should now always be wrapped in JSON. Previously, internal server errors were returned as plain text.

icon:plus[] Core: Various internal structures and dependencies were re-organized and refactored.

icon:plus[] UI: The default set of enabled languages within the `mesh-ui-config.js` file has been updated to include more languages.

[[v0.36.0]]
== 0.36.0 (12.06.2019)

CAUTION: Java Rest Client

[quote]
____

The default field values for `NodeResponse` and `AbstractGenericRestResponse` has been updated. 

The following values have been changed:

* `AbstractGenericRestResponse#permissions`
* `NodeResponse#tags`
* `NodeResponse#childrenInfo`
* `NodeResponse#container`
* `NodeResponse#fields`
* `NodeResponse#breadcrumb`

The `NodeResponse#isContainer` method has been deprecated and was replaced by `NodeResponse#getContainer`

Applications which use affected models will most likely not need to updated since the returned response will always set the affected fields.
____

icon:plus[] REST: The `?fields` query parameter which can be used to filter response properties will now work more granularly on node responses.

CAUTION: Custom node migration scripts have been removed.

[quote]
____

The script system was a source of possible errors and performance problems. Also, the nashorn javascript engine has been deprecated with the release of Java 11. If you need to change data for a migration, use the REST Api instead.
____

icon:check[] REST: Fixed a bug that sometimes caused a wrong image to be sent to the client when using image manipulation. link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh/issues/669[#669]

icon:plus[] REST: Error messages now contain the property `i18nKey`. This allows for easy identification of different errors.

[[v0.35.0]]
== 0.35.0 (06.06.2019)

CAUTION: Rest Model: The `BranchResponse#isMigrated` method has been changed to `BranchResponse#getMigrated`.

NOTE: Fetching fields of a node/micronode in GraphQL requires a different query in `/api/v2`. Please refer to the link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh/issues/428[#428] and link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh/issues/317[#317] for details.

icon:check[] Backup: Fixed `NullPointerException` which occurred when the backup directory was missing and the backup endpoint was invoked. link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh/issues/463[#463]

icon:plus[] Core: The core Vert.x library was updated to version `3.7.1`.

icon:check[] Focal point: It is now possible to use the `{apiLatest}/:projectName/nodes/:uuid/binaryTransform/:fieldName` to resize and image and set the focal point in one operation.

icon:check[] The `Content-Disposition` header will now contain the UTF-8 and ISO-8859-1 encoded filename. link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh/issues/702[#702]

icon:plus[] REST: It is now possible to set a flag that forces a user to change their password on the next login. Take a look at link:{{< relref "authentication.asciidoc" >}}#_forcing_user_to_change_password[the documentation] for more information.

icon:check[] REST: Fixed a bug that sometimes caused a wrong image to be responded when using image manipulation. link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh/issues/669[#669]

[[v0.34.0]]
== 0.34.0 (28.05.2019)

icon:bullhorn[] Versioning Enhancements

[quote]
____

The versioning system has received various enhancements.

link:{{< relref "features.asciidoc" >}}#auto-purge[Auto Purge]

The auto purge feature will now automatically purge the previously no longer needed version of a content. You can control this behaviour using the `autoPurge` flag in the `mesh.yml` file.

Additionally schema's may now contain a `autoPurge` flag to override the setting on a per schema basis.

The documentation contains detailed information about how versioning can be controlled.

link:{{< relref "features.asciidoc" >}}#_listing_versions[Listing Versions]

Versions of a node can now be listed via REST and GraphQL.

link:{{< relref "features.asciidoc" >}}#_purging_versions[Purging Versions]

Versions can now be purged across projects to reduce disk storage usage.
____

icon:check[] Java Rest Client: Fixed a bug that prevented automatic reconnection to the eventbus when it did not succeed immediately.

icon:check[] Upload: The document processing library _tika_ has been updated to version `1.21` to fix potential out of memory issues during upload document processing.

icon:check[] Branch Migration: A bug in the branch migration process has been fixed. Previously the wrong version of the content was used as branch root version. The process will now utilize the published version if one exists and otherwise use the draft version. This fix only affected internal data handling.

[[v0.33.1]]
== 0.33.1 (23.05.2019)

icon:check[] Core: The dependency _hazelcast-kubernetes_ has set to version 1.2.2 to fix a compatibility issue with the used hazelcast version.

[[v0.33.0]]
== 0.33.0 (20.05.2019)

icon:bullhorn[] Elasticsearch document handling

[quote]
____

The support for the Elasticsearch ingest plugin has been removed. The same functionality has been replaced with a much more efficient implementation which extracts the plain text of a document during upload processing. The structure of the generated search index has not changed and thus no modifications on existing search queries is required.

The plain text will now also be included in the REST and GraphQL response of binary fields.

An automatic changelog entry has been added which will parse all uploaded documents and extract the plain text. The duration of the execution of this task depends on the amount of documents that need to be parsed.

The new __mesh.yml__ setting `upload.parserLimit` can be used to control the document parser. See link:{{< relref "features.asciidoc" >}}#_text_extraction[Text extraction documentation] for more information.
____

icon:plus[] Search: The embedded elastichead interface has been removed. It is recommended to use browser extentions like link:https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/elasticsearch-head/ffmkiejjmecolpfloofpjologoblkegm[ElasticSearch Head for Chrome] instead.

icon:check[] Core: Various internal libraries have been updated (logback, hazelcast-kubernetes, tika)

icon:plus[] OrientDB: The included OrientDB version has been updated to version 3.0.19

[[v0.32.0]]
== 0.32.0 (08.05.2019)

icon:bullhorn[] Event Handling

[quote]
____

The event handling mechanism has been completely overhauled.

*Changes*

* Additional events have been added
* Event payload includes more information
* Java Models for events have been added

*API*

The API class `com.gentics.mesh.MeshEvent` was replaced by `com.gentics.mesh.core.rest.MeshEvent`.

A detailed description of this feature can be found in our link:{{< relref "events.asciidoc" >}}[Event Documentation].
____

icon:bullhorn[] Elasticsearch Handling

[quote]
____

The Elasticsearch integration has been overhauled.

*Integration*

Elasticsearch synchronization operations have been decoupled from regular write operations.

This has two main effects. First, regular write operations (e.g. Node Update, Node Create) will not block until the changed data has been synchronized with elasticsearch. This will result in higher overall write performance. Secondly, changes will not be directly visible in Elasticsearch since write operations in Elasticsearch have been decoupled and will be executed asynchronously after a element in Gentics Mesh has been modified. Implementations which highly rely on Gentics Mesh being in sync with ES for each operation may need to be adapted. When using the `/search` or `/rawSearch` endpoints in mesh, you can now provide the `?wait=true` query parameter. See details link:{{< relref "elasticsearch.asciidoc" >}}#endpoints[here]

*Fixes*

Various issues with the previous Elasticsearch synchronization mechanism have been addressed.

* Deletion of nodes will now also update documents in the index which reference the deleted node
* Tag and Tag Family deletion will now correctly update referenced tags, tag families and nodes

*Startup*

Gentics Mesh will no longer wait for Elasticsearch during start-up.

*Resilience*

The resilience for Elasticsearch server issues has been improved. Failed requests will automatically be retried. If too many issues occur Gentics Mesh will automatically invoke an index sync in order to recover from the issue. This sync will be retried until Elasticsearch becomes responsive again.

*Syncing*

The clear and sync mechanism has been streamlined in order to benefit from other changes like resilience.

____

NOTE: It is not required to reindex documents since the index names and structure has not been changed.

icon:check[] File Handling: The file upload mechanism has been overhauled to address issues with blocked uploads which could occur when uploading multiple files in-parallel.

icon:check[] File Handling: Failed Uploads will now remove temporary files from disk. Previously in some error situations the temporary upload have not been removed.

icon:check[] Permissions: Applying permissions recursively on projects did not affect branches. This has been fixed.

icon:plus[] Permissions: Setting permissions recursively is now done more efficiently.

icon:plus[] Thread Usage: The overall request handling has been refactored to reduce situations in which the event-loop threads could be blocked. The request handling code has been unified.

icon:plus[] Core: The core Vert.x library was updated to version 3.7.0

icon:plus[] Performance: The overall read performance has been improved. The memory usage has been reduced.

[[v0.31.6]]
== 0.31.6 (27.05.2018)

icon:check[] Java Rest Client: Fixed a bug that prevented automatic reconnection to the eventbus when it did not succeed immediately.

[[v0.31.5]]
== 0.31.5 (07.05.2019)

icon:check[] REST: The `publish` and `readPublished` permissions are now only shown for nodes.

icon:check[] Core: Creation of schemas with the same name of an existing microschema or vice versa is not allowed anymore. Doing so caused conflicts in GraphQL. link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh/issues/597[#597]

icon:check[] Core: A bug in the image transform endpoint has been fixed. Previously nodes which were updated using that endpoint could not be found via webroot anymore. link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh/issues/599[#599]

icon:plus[] Job: The endpoint `POST {apiLatest}/admin/jobs/:jobUuid/process` has been added. It can be used to trigger job processing. The endpoint will also automatically reset a failed job to be queued again. The endpoints `DELETE {apiLatest}/admin/jobs/:jobUuid/error` and `POST {apiLatest}/admin/processJobs` will be removed in a future release. link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh/issues/171[#171]

icon:check[] Plugins: A `NullPointerException` has been fixed which has happened when accessing `rc.user().principal()` within a plugin. link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh/issues/516[#516]

icon:check[] REST: Creating a schema with a micronode field and the allow option set to `[]` will now allow micronodes of all microschemas. link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh/issues/431[#431]

icon:check[] Core: Fixed a bug that caused an internal server error when applying changes to a microschema. link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh/issues/591[#591]

icon:check[] UI: Fixed validation issues in microschema lists when updating nodes. Previously validation issues would not be detected by the UI and the node update would fail. link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh-ui/pull/202[#202]

[[v0.31.4]]
== 0.31.4 (11.04.2019)

icon:check[] Schema: The `container` flag in the schema update request is now optional. Omitting the value will no longer cause Gentics Mesh to use the default value `false`. Subsequently the java request model was altered. The `Schema#isContainer` method was replaced with `Schema#getContainer`. Older REST client versions which by default always specified the container flag are still compatible with this change. link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh/issues/165[#165]

icon:check[] GraphQL: The permission check for the `nodes` field of the type `Tag` has been fixed. Previously loading tagged nodes for a tag did not return the expected result. The `published` permission for published nodes was not checked correctly. This has been fixed now.

icon:plus[] Logging:  The default `logback.xml` file has been updated to include automatic scan of the logging configuration. This change will not be applied to existing configurations.

icon:check[] Schema: It is now possible to reset the `allow` property of string fields. Setting the `allow` to empty array will now no longer restrict the values. Instead it will revert back to the original behaviour and allow all values.

icon:check[] UI: Fixed a bug that caused the node list to jump to the first page on various actions. link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh-ui/issues/195[#195]


[[v0.31.3]]
== 0.31.3 (28.03.2019)

icon:plus[] Logging: The conflict error logging has been improved. Conflict error information in the log will now be more detailed and also include the conflicting field key and versions.

icon:check[] Permissions: A bug in the GraphQL `nodes` field was fixed. Previously branches were not correctly handled and too many nodes would be returned. Additionally the field would not correctly handle the read published permission and also return draft nodes to which no read permission was granted.

[[v0.31.2]]
== 0.31.2 (22.03.2019)

icon:plus[] Docker: Default memory settings for the server and demo docker images were updated. The `-Dstorage.diskCache.bufferSize=256` setting has been added for the server image. The setting can be changed using the `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS` environment variable. See link:https://getmesh.io/docs/administration-guide/#_memory_settings[Memory documentation] for more information and recommendations.

icon:plus[] OrientDB: The included OrientDB version has been updated to version 3.0.18.

icon:check[] REST: The `GET {apiLatest}/:projectName/nodes/:nodeUuid/binary/:fieldName` endpoint will now always include the `accept-ranges: bytes` header to indicate to the client that it supports range requests. link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh/issues/643[#643]

icon:check[] Configuration: The elasticsearch bulk limit can now be configured using the `MESH_ELASTICSEARCH_BULK_LIMIT` environment variable.

icon:check[] Permissions: A bug in the GraphQL permission handling has been fixed. Previously nodes which had only read published permission assigned to them were not returned using the `nodes` field.

icon:check[] Permissions: A bug in the permission handling of the nav root endpoint has been fixed. Previously nodes which had only read published permission assigned to them were not included in the navigation response.

[[v0.31.1]]
== 0.31.1 (18.03.2019)

icon:plus[] GraphDB Import/Export: The endpoints `POST {apiLatest}/admin/graphdb/export` and `POST {apiLatest}/admin/graphdb/import` have been added.

[[v0.31.0]]
== 0.31.0 (13.03.2019)

icon:bullhorn[] Monitoring

[quote]
____
This version of Gentics Mesh introduces the __Monitoring feature__.

The Gentics Mesh server will now *additionally* to port `8080` also bind to port `8081` in order to provide the new monitoring API. New configuration settings have been added to allow configuration of this server.

NOTE: The monitoring API should not be exposed publicly and will by default only bind to `localhost`.

A detailed description of this feature can be found in our link:{{< relref "monitoring.asciidoc" >}}[Monitoring Documentation].
____

CAUTION: In a future release the following endpoints will be removed from the regular API (Port 8080) since they were moved to the new  monitoring server API (Port 8081).

* `GET {apiLatest}/admin/status` (Server Status)
* `GET {apiLatest}/admin/cluster/status` (Cluster Status)

CAUTION: Because of a change in the image resizer, the change below might not apply when an image is already in the cache. To make sure that the changes take effect, the cache in `data/binaryImageCache/` must be cleared.

icon:plus[] Image: Quality of manipulated JPEG images can now be configured. The default value has been changed from `0.7` to `0.95`.

icon:plus[] Image: The filter for resizing images can now be configured. The default filter is Lanczos.

icon:plus[] OrientDB: The included OrientDB version has been updated to version 3.0.17.

icon:plus[] REST: The `/users` endpoint response will now contain a hash of a users roles.

icon:plus[] GraphQL: The `roles` field is now available for user fields, and contains all roles of the respective user.

icon:plus[] GraphQL: The `rolesHash` field is now available for user fields, and contains a hash of all the roles of the respective user. This field does not need any special permissions.

icon:check[] Fixed a bug in the consistency checks which claimed missing user role shortcuts.

icon:check[] Schema: A bug was fixed which prevented the update of the schema field `elasticsearch` property to value null.

icon:plus[] Docker: Default memory settings for the server and demo docker images were added. Default for server is set to `-Xms512m -Xmx512m -XX:MaxDirectMemorySize=256m`. The setting can be changed using the `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS` environment variable. See link:https://getmesh.io/docs/administration-guide/#_memory_settings[Memory documentation] for more information.

icon:check[] The `.vertx` cache folder was moved to the configurable `data/tmp` folder.

[[v0.30.2]]

[[v0.30.0]]
== 0.30.0 (12.02.2019)

CAUTION: Java Rest Client: The Gentics Mesh Java REST client which was based on Vert.x was replaced with a `OkHttpClient` implementation. Some changes to the client interface were necessary to make the client independent of Vert.x. See link:https://getmesh.io/docs/platforms/#_java[this example] and the Javadoc for more information.

icon:check[] Clustering: The mesh version will no longer be appended  to the node name used for OrientDB clustering. It is recommended to sanitize the `data/graphdb/storage/distributed-db-config.json` file and remove/rename entries which reference older mesh nodes. Only the active nodes should be listed in the file.

icon:check[] Core: Fixed a bug that caused too long responses on binary range requests.

icon:check[] GraphQL: Fixed a bug when loading a node via path. When the node itself did not exist, the query would return its parent node.

[[v0.29.10]]
== 0.29.10 (08.02.2019)

icon:check[] Clustering: Cluster stability has been increased by reducing concurrent transaction locks during delete requests.

[[v0.29.9]]

[[v0.29.6]]
== 0.29.6 (01.02.2019)

icon:plus[] Core: The way editor references are stored has been refactored to increase performance and reduce contention during database operations. A changelog entry will be invoked which migrates the data.

[[v0.29.5]]
== 0.29.5 (31.01.2019)

icon:check[] Clustering: Creation of edges which lead to higher contention in the graph have been removed from job's. Job's will currently no longer reference the creator.

icon:plus[] OrientDB: The included OrientDB version has been updated to version 3.0.14

icon:check[] Core: The job processing will no longer be invoked in an interval in order to reduce cluster operation contention. Instead the `{apiLatest}/admin/processJobs` endpoint can be used to manually trigger job processing.

icon:check[] Core: Fixed a bug that caused nodes with a slash in their segment field to not be found via webroot.

icon:check[] Restore: A `ClassCastException` has been fixed which could be observed directly after a backup restore operation.

icon:check[] Changelog: The automatic backup of OrientDB configurations which was executed during the 0.29.0 update has been removed.

[[v0.29.2]]
== 0.29.2 (18.01.2019)

icon:plus[] Changelog: The changelog execution performance has been increased.

icon:plus[] Consistency Checks: Additional consistency checks and repair actions have been added.

icon:check[] Restore: An error will be returned when `{apiLatest}/admin/graphdb/restore` is being invoked in clustered mode. Restoring the database is not possible in this mode.

icon:check[] Elasticsearch: Fixed a bug that caused a schema migration to never be finished. This affected nodes with binaries that are readable by the Elasticsearch Ingest Attachment Processor Plugin.

icon:check[] Image: Resizing images will now use the balanced quality setting. This helps with images that suffered from visible aliasing. To make sure that the changes take effect, the cache in `data/binaryImageCache/` must be cleared.

[[v0.29.1]]
== 0.29.1 (16.01.2019)

CAUTION: Because of a change in the image cache, the change below might not apply when an image is already in the cache. To make sure that the changes take effect, the cache in `data/binaryImageCache/` must be cleared.

icon:plus[] Core: Performance of the deletion process has been increased.

icon:plus[] Consistency Checks: Additional consistency checks and repair actions have been added.

icon:plus[] Consistency Checks: The consistency endpoint response will now also list a `repairCount` property which lists the count of repair operations. 
            The response will now only contain the first 200 results. The `outputTruncated` property indicates whether the result has been truncated.

icon:check[] Image: Resizing and cropping will no longer transform the image to JPG format but return an image in the original format. When no image writing plugin for this format is available the fallback is PNG.

icon:check[] Core: Node deletion will now also remove connected lists and micronodes. Previously these elements were not properly removed. On large systems this could lead to increased disk usage.

[[v0.29.0]]
== 0.29.0 (14.01.2019)

CAUTION: The embedded Graph Database was updated from version 2.2.37 to 3.0.13. See required changes below.

icon:plus[] OrientDB 3.0.x: Existing `orientdb-server-config.xml`, `hazelcast.xml`, `default-distributed-db-config.json` configuration files will automatically be moved away and the new configuration files will be created instead.

== 0.28.3 (09.01.2019)

icon:check[] GraphQL: Resolved links will now contain the hostname of the target branch, not the latest branch.

icon:check[] Elasticsearch: Search indices are now created sequentially. Parallel creation of indices caused problems when many indices would have to be created.

icon:plus[] Core: When resolving links with type FULL, and the chosen branch is not the latest branch, the query parameter for the branch will be added to the rendered link.

icon:plus[] Java Rest Client: Added new REST client implementation. The `MeshRestOkHttpClientImpl` implementation will replace the current Java client in a future release. It is advised to switch to the new implementation which is based on the OkHttp library instead of Vert.x.

[[v0.28.2]]
== 0.28.2 (26.11.2018)

icon:check[] Changelog: Enhanced changelog entry fix from release `0.28.1` to fix additional issues.

[[v0.28.1]]
== 0.28.1 (26.11.2018)

icon:plus[] Java Rest Client: The `version` property of the `NodeUpdateRequest` is now by default set to `draft`. Setting the value to draft will override the conflict detection handling and always compare the posted data with the latest draft version.

icon:plus[] Java Rest Client: The `upsertNode` method has been added to the REST client which can be used to create or update a node.

icon:plus[] Demo: The example uuids and dates in the `{apiLatest}/raml` response and the documentation are now static and will no longer change between releases. link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh/issues/477[#477]

icon:plus[] Core: Deletion of micronode and list field data has been implemented in the core. Previously these elements were not removed from the graph. link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh/issues/192[#192]

icon:check[] Changelog: Fixed a bug in the webroot index database migration entry which caused a `ORecordDuplicatedException` changelog error and prevented update and startup of older databases. link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh/issues/554[#554], link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh/issues/546[#546]

icon:check[] Core: Fixed a bug that caused link:https://getmesh.io/docs/api/#project__branches__branchUuid__migrateSchemas_post[/migrateSchemas] to fail when a newer schema version was not assigned to the branch. link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh/issues/532[#532]

icon:check[] Core: Nodes are now migrated to the newest schema version when a new branch is created. link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh/issues/521[#521]

icon:check[] Core: Fixed a bug that prevented moving a published node in one language to a published container of another language.

[[v0.28.0]]
== 0.28.0 (20.11.2018)

CAUTION: The property `meshNodeId` of the `{apiLatest}/` response was renamed to `meshNodeName` to be more consistent.

icon:plus[] REST: It is now possible to set existing or new tags during node creation and node update. Tags that are listed in both of those requests will be created if not found and assigned to the updated or created node.

icon:plus[] Eventbus: It is now possible to register custom eventbus addresses.

icon:plus[] REST: Download of binaries will now support byte range requests. Web media players require this feature in order to support seeking in video streams.

icon:plus[] API: Make OAuth2 Server options overrideable via environment variables.

icon:check[] Permissions: A bug in the permission handling has been fixed. Previously the read permission was also granted when create was granted to elements. link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh/issues/562[#562]

icon:check[] REST: An error which prevented the `{apiLatest}` info endpoint from returning version information has been fixed.

icon:plus[] OrientDB: The included OrientDB Studio has been updated to version 2.2.32.

icon:plus[] Config: It is now possible to configure the JVM arguments of the embedded Elasticsearch server via the `search.embeddedArguments` property in the `mesh.yml` file.

icon:plus[] GraphQL: Schema fields can now be queried. Currently supported are `name`, `label`, `required` and `type`.

[[v0.15.0]]
== 0.15.0 (31.01.2018)

CAUTION: The embedded Elasticsearch was removed and replaced by a connector to a dedicated Elasticsearch server. It is highly recommended to verify existing queries due to breaking changes between Elasticsearch version 2.4 and 6.1.
Please also check the Elasticsearch changelog: link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/release-notes-6.1.0.html[Elasticsearch Changelog]

CAUTION: Configuration: The `mesh.yml` format has been updated. Please remove the `search` section or replace it with the following settings.

[source,json]
----
search:
  hosts:
  - hostname: "localhost"
    port: 9200
    protocol: "http"
  startEmbeddedES: true
----

CAUTION: The Elasticsearch update may affect custom mappings within your schemas. You may need to manually update your schemas.

Elasticsearch 6.1 compliant example for the commonly used raw field:

[source,json]
----
{
    "fields": {
        "raw": {
            "type": "keyword",
            "index": true
        }
    }
}
----

CAUTION: The `unfilteredCount` GraphQL paging property has been removed. You can now use the `totalCount` property instead.

CAUTION: Gentics Mesh will automatically extract and start an embedded Elasticsearch server into the `elasticsearch` folder. The old search index (e.g: `data/searchIndex`) can be removed. 

CAUTION: The user which is used to run the process within the docker image has been changed. You may need to update your data volume ownership to uid/gid 1000.

icon:plus[] REST: The UUID of the referenced binary data will now also be listed for binary fields. Fields which share the same binary data will also share the same binary UUID.

icon:plus[] GraphQL: It is now possible to read the focal point information and binary uuid of binary fields.

icon:plus[] Docs: The link:{{< relref "elasticsearch.asciidoc" >}}[Elasticsearch integration documentation] has been enhanced.

icon:plus[] Search: The overall search performance has been increased.

icon:plus[] Logging: The logging verbosity has been further decreased.

[[v0.14.2]]
== 0.14.2 (30.01.2018)

icon:check[] Elasticsearch: Fixed a bug which caused an internal error when granting multiple permissions to the same element at the same time.

icon:check[] GraphQL: The `linkType` parameter for string and html fields now causes the the link to be rendered in the language of the queried node if no language information is given.

[[v0.14.1]]
== 0.14.1 (19.01.2018)

icon:check[] Core: Fixed a deadlock situation which could occur when handling more than 20 image resize requests in parallel. Image resize operations will now utilize a dedicated thread pool.

icon:check[] Core: Fixed a bug which caused permission inconsistencies when deleting a group from the system.

icon:plus[] REST: Added support to automatically handle the `Expect: 100-Continue` header. We however recommend to only use this header for upload requests.
Using this header will otherwise reduce the response times of your requests. Note that PHP curl will add this header by default.
You can read more about the link:https://support.urbanairship.com/hc/en-us/articles/213492003--Expect-100-Continue-Issues-and-Risks[header here].

[[v0.14.0]]
== 0.14.0 (16.01.2018)

CAUTION: The image manipulation query parameters `cropx`, `cropy`, `croph` and `cropw` have been replaced by the `rect` parameter. The `rect` parameter contains the needed values `rect=x,y,w,h`.

CAUTION: The image manipulation query parameter `width` was renamed to `w`. The parameter `height` was renamed to `h`.

CAUTION: The binary transformation request request was updated. The crop parameters are now nested within the `cropRect` object.

CAUTION: It is now required to specify the crop mode when cropping an image. Possible crop modes are `rect` which will utilize the specified crop area or `fp` which will utilize the focal point information in order to crop the image.

icon:plus[] Image: It is now possible to specify a focal point within the binary field of an image.
                   This focal point can be used to automatically crop the image in a way so that the focused area is kept in the image.
                   The focal point can also be manually specified when requesting an image.
                   This will overrule any previously stored focal point information within the binary field.

icon:plus[] UI: The admin UI has been updated to use the renamed image parameters.

icon:check[] Storage: Binary field deletion has been made more resilient and will no longer fail if the referenced binary data is not stored within used binary storage. link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh/issues/235[#235]

icon:plus[] REST: The `hostname` and `ssl` properties have been added to the project create request. This information will be directly added to the initial release of the project. The properties can thus be changed by updating the project.

icon:plus[] REST: The link resolver mechanism was enhanced to also consider the `hostname` and `ssl` flag of the release of the node which is linked. 
                  The link resolver will make use of these properties as soon as mesh links point to nodes of foreign projects.
                  You can read more on this topic in the link:{{< relref "features.asciidoc" >}}#crossdomainlinks[cross domain link section] of our documentation.

== 0.11.6 (15.12.2017)

icon:plus[] Search: The automatic recreation of the search index will now also occur if an empty search index folder was found.

icon:check[] UI: Nodes are now always reloaded when the edit button is clicked in the explorer content list. link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh-ui/issues/16[#16]

icon:check[] UI: Fixed an issue that was causing a click on a node in the explorer list to open it like a container, even if it is not a container.

icon:check[] UI: Dropdowns for required string fields with the allowed attribute now properly require a value to be set in order to save the node.

icon:check[] UI: Fixed a issue where contents of a micronode were not validated before saving a node.

icon:check[] Core: Reduce the memory load of the ChangeNumberStringsToNumber-changelog by reducing the size of a single transactions.

icon:check[] Image: Image handling has been optimized. Previously resizing larger images could temporarily lock up the http server.

icon:plus[] UI: Add multi binary upload dialogue. Users can now upload multiple files at once by clicking the button next to the create node button.

icon:plus[] UI: Binary fields can now be used as display fields. The filename is used as the display name for the node. link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh-ui/issues/11[#11]

icon:plus[] UI: It is now possible to specify the URL to the front end of a system. This allows users to quickly go to the page that represents the node in the system.
  See the default `mesh-ui-config.js` or the link:{{< relref "user-interface.asciidoc" >}}#_configuration[online documentation] for more details. link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh-ui/issues/14[#14]

icon:plus[] Upload: The upload handling code has been refactored in order to process the uploaded data in-parallel.

icon:plus[] Storage: The binary storage mechanism has been overhauled in preparation for Amazon S3 / link:https://minio.io/[Minio] support.
                     The data within the local binary storage folder and all binary fields will automatically be migrated.
                     The created `binaryFilesMigrationBackup` folder must be manually removed once the migration has finished.

icon:plus[] Core: The OrientDB graph database was updated to version 2.2.31

icon:plus[] Core: Binary fields can now be chosen as display fields. The value of the display field is the filename of the binary.

icon:plus[] REST: The display name has been added to the node response. It can be found in the key `displayName`.

icon:plus[] GraphQL: The display name can now be fetched from a node via the `displayName` field.

icon:check[] UI: Nodes in the "Select Node..." dialogue are now sorted by their display name. link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh-ui/issues/15[#15]

icon:check[] UI: The "Select Node..." dialogue now remembers the last position it was opened. link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh-ui/issues/12[#12]

icon:check[] UI: The dropdown for list types in the schema editor now only shows valid list types.

icon:check[] UI: Fixed a bug that causes image preview to disappear after saving a node. link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh-ui/issues/18[#18]

icon:check[] Core: A bug has been fixed which prevented node updates. The issue occurred once a node was updated from which a language variant was previously deleted.

icon:check[] Search: The search index will now automatically be recreated if the search index folder could not be found.

icon:check[] Core: The values of number-fields where stored as strings in the database which caused issues when converting numbers to and from string. 
                   This has been fixed: the values of number-fields will now be stored as numbers.

icon:check[] Schema: The schema deletion process will now also include all schema versions, referenced changes and jobs.

icon:check[] Clustering: A NPE which could occur during initial setup of a clustered instance has been fixed.

== 0.11.4 (07.12.2017)

icon:check[] Elasticsearch: In some cases the connection to Elasticsearch was not directly ready during start up. This caused various issues. A start-up check has been added in order to prevent this.

icon:check[] Schema: A bug within the schema update mechanism which removed the urlField property value has been fixed.

icon:check[] Elasticsearch: A deadlock situation which could occur during schema validation was fixed.

== 0.11.0 (11.11.2017)

CAUTION: GraphQL: The root field `releases` has been removed. The root field `release` now takes no parameters and loads the active release.

CAUTION: Elasticsearch: Search queries will now automatically be wrapped in a boolean query in order to check permissions much more efficiently. 

CAUTION: The schema field property `searchIndex` / `searchIndex.addRaw` has been removed. The property was replaced by a mapping definition which can be added to each field. 
         All schemas will automatically be migrated to the new format. Please keep in mind to also update any existing schema files which you may have stored externally.

```json
{
  "name": "dummySchema",
  "displayField": "name",
  "fields": [
    {
      "name": "name",
      "label": "Name",
      "required": true,
      "type": "string",
      "elasticsearch": {
        "raw": {
          "index": "not_analyzed",
          "type": "string"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

icon:plus[] Schema: It is now possible to configure index settings and custom search index field mappings within the schema. 

The index settings can be used to define new link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-analyzers.html[analyzers] and link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-tokenizers.html[tokenizer] or other additional link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/_index_settings.html[index settings].
The specified settings will automatically be merged with a default set of settings. 

Once a new analyzer has been defined it can be referenced by custom field mappings which can now be added to each field.
The specified field mapping will be added to the generated fields property of the mapping. You can read more about this topic in the link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/multi-fields.html[fields mapping documentation] of Elasticsearch.

```json
{
  "name": "dummySchema",
  "displayField": "name",
  "elasticsearch": {
    "settings": {
      "number_of_shards" :   1,
      "number_of_replicas" : 0
    },
    "analysis" : {
      "analyzer" : {
        "suggest" : {
          "tokenizer" : "mesh_default_ngram_tokenizer",
          "char_filter" : [ "html_strip" ],
          "filter" : [ "lowercase" ]
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "fields": [
    {
      "name": "name",
      "label": "Name",
      "required": true,
      "type": "string",
      "elasticsearch": {
        "suggest": {
          "analyzer": "suggest",
          "type": "string"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

You can use the `POST {apiLatest}/utilities/validateSchema` endpoint to validate and inspect the effective index configuration.

icon:plus[] REST: The `POST {apiLatest}/utilities/validateSchema` and `POST {apiLatest}/utilities/validateMicroschema` endpoints can now be used to validate a schema/microschema JSON without actually storing it.
                     The validation response will also contain the generated Elasticsearch index configuration.

icon:plus[] GraphQL: Nodes can now be loaded in the context of a schema. This will return all nodes which use the schema.

icon:plus[] Search: The `{apiLatest}/rawSearch/..` and `{apiLatest}/:projectName/rawSearch/..` endpoints have been added. These can be used to invoke search requests which will return the raw elasticsearch response JSON.
                       The needed indices will automatically be selected in order to only return the type specific documents. Read permissions on the document will also be automatically checked.

icon:plus[] Search: Error information for failed Elasticsearch queries will now be added to the response.

icon:plus[] Webroot: The schema property `urlFields` can now used to specify fields which contain webroot paths.
                     The webroot endpoint in turn will first try to find a node which specified the requested path.
                     If no path could be found using the urlField values the regular segment path will be used to locate the node.
                     This feature can be used to set custom urls or short urls for your nodes.

icon:check[] Performance: Optimized binary download memory usage.

icon:check[] REST: Fixed a bug which prevented pages with more then 2000 items from being loaded.

== 0.10.4 (10.10.2017)

CAUTION: REST: The `availableLanguages` field now also contains the publish information of the languages of a node.

icon:check[] REST: Fixed a bug in the permission system. Permissions on microschemas will now correctly be updated when applying permission recursively on projects.

icon:check[] REST: ETags will now be updated if the permission on the element changes.

icon:check[] Core: Various bugs within the schema / microschema migration code have been addressed and fixed.

icon:check[] Core: The search index handling has been updated. A differential synchronization will be run to update the new search index and thus the old index data can still be used.

icon:check[] Performance: Removing permissions has been optimized.

icon:plus[] UI: A new action was added to the node action context menu. It is now possible to unpublish nodes.

icon:plus[] UI: The Mesh UI was updated.

icon:plus[] Config: It is now possible to configure the host to which the Gentics Mesh http server should bind to via the `httpServer.host` setting in the `mesh.yml` file. Default is still 0.0.0.0 (all interfaces).

icon:plus[] The *Webroot-Response-Type* header can now be used to differentiate between a webroot binary and node responses. The values of this header can either be *binary* or *node*.

icon:plus[] The `{apiLatest}/admin/status/migrations` endpoint was removed.
            The status of a migration job can now be obtained via the `{apiLatest}/admin/jobs` endpoint. Successfully executed jobs will no longer be removed from the job list.

icon:plus[] The `{apiLatest}/:projectName/release/:releaseUuid/schemas` and `{apiLatest}/:projectName/release/:releaseUuid/microschemas` endpoint has been reworked.
            The response format has been updated. The status and uuid of the job which has been invoked when the migration was started will now also be included in this response. 

icon:check[] Java REST Client: A potential threading issue within the Java REST Client has been fixed. Vert.x http clients will no longer be shared across multiple threads.

icon:check[] Memory: Reduce memory footprint of microschema migrations. link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh/issues/135[#135]

icon:check[] Fixed handling "required" and "allow" properties of schema fields when adding fields to schemas.

== 0.10.1 (08.09.2017)

icon:plus[] Node Migration: The node migration performance has been increased.

icon:plus[] REST: Added new endpoints `{apiLatest}/admin/jobs` to list and check queued migration jobs. The new endpoints are described in the link:{{< relref "features.asciidoc" >}}#_executing_migrations[feature documentation].

icon:check[] Search: The `raw` field will no longer be added by default to the search index. Instead it can be added using the new `searchIndex.addRaw` flag within the schema field.
             Please note that the raw field value in the search index will be automatically truncated to a size of 32KB. Otherwise the value can't be added to search index.

icon:check[] Migration: Interrupted migrations will now automatically be started again after the server has been started. Failed migration jobs can be purged or reset via the `{apiLatest}/admin/jobs` endpoint.

icon:check[] Migration: Migrations will no longer fail if a required field was added. The field will be created and no value will be set. Custom migration scripts can still be used to add a custom default value during migration.

icon:check[] Node Migration: A bug has been fixed which prevented node migrations with more then 5000 elements from completing.

icon:check[] GraphQL: Updated GraphiQL browser to latest version to fix various issues when using aliases.

== 0.10.0 (04.09.2017)


CAUTION: Manual Change: Configuration changes. For already existing `mesh.yml` files, the `nodeName` setting has to be added. Choose any name for the mesh instance.

CAUTION: Manual Change: Configuration changes. The `clusterMode` setting has been deprecated in favour of the new cluster configuration. This setting must be removed from the `mesh.yml` file.

[CAUTION]
=====================================================================
Manual Change: The configuration files `mesh.yml`, `keystore.jceks` must be moved to a subfolder `config` folder.

[source,bash]
----
mkdir config
mv mesh.yml config
mv keystore.jceks config
----
=====================================================================

[CAUTION]
=====================================================================
Manual Change: The graph database folder needs to be moved. Please create the `storage` subfolder and move the existing data into that folder.

[source,bash]
----
mkdir -p data/graphdb/storage
mv data/graphdb/* data/graphdb/storage/
----
=====================================================================

icon:plus[] Clustering: This release introduces the master-master clustering support. You can read more about clustering and the configuration in the link:{{< relref "clustering.asciidoc" >}}[clustering documentation].

icon:plus[] Core: The OrientDB graph database was updated to version 2.2.26

icon:plus[] REST: The `{apiLatest}/admin/consistency/check` endpoint has been added. The endpoint can be used to verify the database integrity.

icon:check[] Core: Fixed missing OrientDB roles and users for some older graph databases. Some graph databases did not create the needed OrientDB user and roles. These roles and users are needed for the OrientDB server and are different from Gentics Mesh users and roles.

icon:check[] REST: Invalid date strings were not correctly handled. An error will now be thrown if a date string can't be parsed.

icon:check[] REST: The delete handling has been updated.
                   It is now possible to specify the `?recursive=true` parameter to recursively delete nodes.
                   By default `?recursive=false` will be used. Deleting a node which contains children will thus cause an error.
                   The behaviour of node language deletion has been updated as well. Deleting the last language of a node will also remove this node. This removal will again fail if no `?recursive=true` query parameter has been added.

== 0.9.28 (28.08.2017)

icon:check[] Core: The permission check system has been updated. The elements which have only `readPublished` permission can now also be read if the user has only `read` permission. The `read` permission automatically also grants `readPublished`.

icon:check[] Java REST Client: The classes `NodeResponse` and `MicronodeField` now correctly implement the interface `FieldContainer`.

icon:check[] REST: The endpoint `{apiLatest}/{projectName}/nodes/{nodeUuid}/binary/{fieldName}` did not correctly handle the read published nodes permission. This has been fixed now. link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh/issues/111[#111]

== 0.9.27 (23.08.2017)

icon:plus[] GraphQL: It is now possible to retrieve the unfiltered result count. This count is directly loaded from the search provider and may not match up with the exact filtered count.
            The advantage of this value is that it can be retrieved very fast.

icon:plus[] Java REST Client: The client now also supports encrypted connections.

icon:check[] REST: Invalid date were not correctly handled. An error will now be thrown if a date string can't be parsed.

icon:check[] GraphQL: Various errors which occurred when loading a schema of a node via GraphQL have been fixed now.

== 0.9.26 (10.08.2017)

icon:plus[] UI: Added CORS support. Previously CORS was not supported by the UI.

icon:check[] REST API: Added a missing allowed CORS headers which were needed to use the Gentics Mesh UI in a CORS environment.

icon:check[] UI: Fixed translation action. Previously a error prevented translations from being executed.

icon:check[] UI: Fixed image handling for binary fields. Previously only the default language image was displayed in the edit view. This has been fixed.

== 0.9.25 (09.08.2017)

icon:plus[] Demo: The demo dump extraction will now also work if an empty data exists. This is useful when providing a docker mount for the demo data.

icon:plus[] GraphQL: The paging performance has been improved.

icon:plus[] Core: Various missing permission checks have been added.

This version of Gentics Mesh introduces versioning of contents. A detailed description of the versioning feature can be found in our https://getmesh.io/docs[Documentation].

Important changes summary:

* Node update request must now include the version information
* The query parameter `?version=published` must be used to load published nodes. Otherwise the node will not be found because the default version scope is __draft__.
