icon:bullhorn[] Metadata extraction

[quote]
____
This version of Gentics Mesh introduces the __Metadata extraction__ of file uploads (PDF, Images).
GPS information of images will now be added to the search index. That information can be used to run link:https://getmesh.io/docs/beta/elasticsearch.html#_search_nodes_by_geolocation_of_images[geo search queries].
A detailed description of this feature can be found in our https://getmesh.io/docs/beta/features.html#_metadata_handling[File Uploads Documentation].

Existing binary fields will not be automatically be processed to provide the metadata. You need to manually re-upload the data in order to generate the metadata properties.
____

icon:check[] Image: Focal point information within binary fields will now be utilized when invoking a download request which contains `?crop=fp&height=200&width=100`. Previously the stored information was not used and no focal point cropping was executed. link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh/issues/417[#417]

icon:check[] Schema: A minor issue within the schema diff mechanism has been fixed. Previously the `elasticsearch` property was not correctly handled if an empty object has been provided during an update.

[[v0.21.5]]
== 0.21.5 (14.07.2018)

icon:plus[] Core: Gentics Mesh can now be downgraded if the link:https://getmesh.io/docs/beta/administration-guide.html#database-revisions[database revision] matches the needed revision of Gentics Mesh.

icon:plus[] Clustering: Gentics Mesh is now able to form cluster between different server versions. 
			A database revision hash will now be used to determine which versions of Gentics Mesh can form a cluster.
			Only instances with the same database revision hash are allowed to form a cluster.
			The current revision hash info is included in the `/api/v1` endpoint response.

icon:plus[] Various settings can now be overridden via link:https://getmesh.io/docs/beta/administration-guide.html#_environment_variables[environment variables]. This is useful when dealing with docker based deployments.

icon:check[] Elasticsearch: Search requests failed on systems with many schemas. link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh/issues/303[#303]

icon:check[] Elasticsearch: Fixed handling of `search.url` settings which contained a https URL.

[[v0.15.0]]
== 0.15.0 (31.01.2018)

CAUTION: The embedded Elasticsearch was removed and replaced by a connector to a dedicated Elasticsearch server. It is highly recommended to verify existing queries due to breaking changes between Elasticsearch version 2.4 and 6.1.
Please also check the Elasticsearch changelog: link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/release-notes-6.1.0.html[Elasticsearch Changelog]

CAUTION: Configuration: The `mesh.yml` format has been updated. Please remove the `search` section or replace it with the following settings.

[source,json]
----
search:
  hosts:
  - hostname: "localhost"
    port: 9200
    protocol: "http"
  startEmbeddedES: true
----

CAUTION: The Elasticsearch update may affect custom mappings within your schemas. You may need to manually update your schemas.

Elasticsearch 6.1 compliant example for the commonly used raw field:

[source,json]
----
{
    "fields": {
        "raw": {
            "type": "keyword",
            "index": true
        }
    }
}
----

CAUTION: The `unfilteredCount` GraphQL paging property has been removed. You can now use the `totalCount` property instead.

CAUTION: Gentics Mesh will automatically extract and start an embedded Elasticsearch server into the `elasticsearch` folder. The old search index (e.g: `data/searchIndex`) can be removed. 

CAUTION: The user which is used to run the process within the docker image has been changed. You may need to update your data volume ownership to uid/gid 1000.

icon:plus[] REST: The UUID of the referenced binary data will now also be listed for binary fields. Fields which share the same binary data will also share the same binary UUID.

icon:plus[] GraphQL: It is now possible to read the focal point information and binary uuid of binary fields.

icon:plus[] Docs: The link:elasticsearch.html[Elasticsearch integration documentation] has been enhanced.

icon:plus[] Search: The overall search performance has been increased.

[[v0.14.1]]
== 0.14.1 (19.01.2018)

icon:check[] Core: Fixed a deadlock situation which could occur when handling more than 20 image resize requests in parallel. Image resize operations will now utilize a dedicated thread pool.

icon:check[] Core: Fixed a bug which caused permission inconsistencies when deleting a group from the system.

icon:plus[] REST: Added support to automatically handle the `Expect: 100-Continue` header. We however recommend to only use this header for upload requests.
Using this header will otherwise reduce the response times of your requests. Note that PHP curl will add this header by default.
You can read more about the link:https://support.urbanairship.com/hc/en-us/articles/213492003--Expect-100-Continue-Issues-and-Risks[header here].

[[v0.14.0]]
== 0.14.0 (16.01.2018)

CAUTION: The image manipulation query parameters `cropx`, `cropy`, `croph` and `cropw` have been replaced by the `rect` parameter. The `rect` parameter contains the needed values `rect=x,y,w,h`.

CAUTION: The image manipulation query parameter `width` was renamed to `w`. The parameter `height` was renamed to `h`.

CAUTION: The binary transformation request request was updated. The crop parameters are now nested within the `cropRect` object.

CAUTION: It is now required to specify the crop mode when cropping an image. Possible crop modes are `rect` which will utilize the specified crop area or `fp` which will utilize the focal point information in order to crop the image.

icon:plus[] Image: It is now possible to specify a focal point within the binary field of an image.
                   This focal point can be used to automatically crop the image in a way so that the focused area is kept in the image.
                   The focal point can also be manually specified when requesting an image.
                   This will overrule any previously stored focal point information within the binary field.

icon:check[] Elasticsearch: A deadlock situation which could occur during schema validation was fixed.

== 0.11.0 (11.11.2017)

CAUTION: GraphQL: The root field `releases` has been removed. The root field `release` now takes no parameters and loads the active release.

CAUTION: Elasticsearch: Search queries will now automatically be wrapped in a boolean query in order to check permissions much more efficiently. 

CAUTION: The schema field property `searchIndex` / `searchIndex.addRaw` has been removed. The property was replaced by a mapping definition which can be added to each field. 
         All schemas will automatically be migrated to the new format. Please keep in mind to also update any existing schema files which you may have stored externally.

```json
{
  "name": "dummySchema",
  "displayField": "name",
  "fields": [
    {
      "name": "name",
      "label": "Name",
      "required": true,
      "type": "string",
      "elasticsearch": {
        "raw": {
          "index": "not_analyzed",
          "type": "string"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

icon:plus[] Schema: It is now possible to configure index settings and custom search index field mappings within the schema. 

The index settings can be used to define new link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-analyzers.html[analyzers] and link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-tokenizers.html[tokenizer] or other additional link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/_index_settings.html[index settings].
The specified settings will automatically be merged with a default set of settings. 

Once a new analyzer has been defined it can be referenced by custom field mappings which can now be added to each field.
The specified field mapping will be added to the generated fields property of the mapping. You can read more about this topic in the link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/multi-fields.html[fields mapping documentation] of Elasticsearch.

```json
{
  "name": "dummySchema",
  "displayField": "name",
  "elasticsearch": {
    "settings": {
      "number_of_shards" :   1,
      "number_of_replicas" : 0
    },
    "analysis" : {
      "analyzer" : {
        "suggest" : {
          "tokenizer" : "mesh_default_ngram_tokenizer",
          "char_filter" : [ "html_strip" ],
          "filter" : [ "lowercase" ]
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "fields": [
    {
      "name": "name",
      "label": "Name",
      "required": true,
      "type": "string",
      "elasticsearch": {
        "suggest": {
          "analyzer": "suggest",
          "type": "string"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

You can use the `POST /api/v1/utilities/validateSchema` endpoint to validate and inspect the effective index configuration.

icon:plus[] REST: The `POST /api/v1/utilities/validateSchema` and `POST /api/v1/utilities/validateMicroschema` endpoints can now be used to validate a schema/microschema JSON without actually storing it.
                     The validation response will also contain the generated Elasticsearch index configuration.

icon:plus[] GraphQL: Nodes can now be loaded in the context of a schema. This will return all nodes which use the schema.

icon:plus[] Search: The `/api/v1/rawSearch/..` and `/api/v1/:projectName/rawSearch/..` endpoints have been added. These can be used to invoke search requests which will return the raw elasticsearch response JSON. 
                       The needed indices will automatically be selected in order to only return the type specific documents. Read permissions on the document will also be automatically checked.

icon:plus[] Search: Error information for failed Elasticsearch queries will now be added to the response.

icon:plus[] Webroot: The schema property `urlFields` can now used to specify fields which contain webroot paths.
                     The webroot endpoint in turn will first try to find a node which specified the requested path.
                     If no path could be found using the urlField values the regular segment path will be used to locate the node.
                     This feature can be used to set custom urls or short urls for your nodes.

icon:check[] Performance: Optimized binary download memory usage.

icon:check[] REST: Fixed a bug which prevented pages with more then 2000 items from being loaded.

== 0.10.4 (10.10.2017)

icon:plus[] The `/api/v1/admin/status/migrations` endpoint was removed. 
            The status of a migration job can now be obtained via the `/api/v1/admin/jobs` endpoint. Successfully executed jobs will no longer be removed from the job list.

icon:plus[] The `/api/v1/:projectName/release/:releaseUuid/schemas` and `/api/v1/:projectName/release/:releaseUuid/microschemas` endpoint has been reworked.
            The response format has been updated. The status and uuid of the job which has been invoked when the migration was started will now also be included in this response.

icon:plus[] Node Migration: The node migration performance has been increased.

icon:plus[] REST: Added new endpoints `/api/v1/admin/jobs` to list and check queued migration jobs. The new endpoints are described in the link:https://getmesh.io/docs/beta/features.html#_executing_migrations[feature documentation].

icon:check[] Search: The `raw` field will no longer be added by default to the search index. Instead it can be added using the new `searchIndex.addRaw` flag within the schema field.
             Please note that the raw field value in the search index will be automatically truncated to a size of 32KB. Otherwise the value can't be added to search index.

icon:check[] Migration: Interrupted migrations will now automatically be started again after the server has been started. Failed migration jobs can be purged or reset via the `/api/v1/admin/jobs` endpoint.

icon:check[] Migration: Migrations will no longer fail if a required field was added. The field will be created and no value will be set. Custom migration scripts can still be used to add a custom default value during migration.

icon:check[] Node Migration: A bug has been fixed which prevented node migrations with more then 5000 elements from completing.

icon:check[] GraphQL: Updated GraphiQL browser to latest version to fix various issues when using aliases.

== 0.10.0 (04.09.2017)


CAUTION: Manual Change: Configuration changes. For already existing `mesh.yml` files, the `nodeName` setting has to be added. Choose any name for the mesh instance.

CAUTION: Manual Change: Configuration changes. The `clusterMode` setting has been deprecated in favour of the new cluster configuration. This setting must be removed from the `mesh.yml` file.

[CAUTION]
=====================================================================
Manual Change: The configuration files `mesh.yml`, `keystore.jceks` must be moved to a subfolder `config` folder.

[source,bash]
----
mkdir config
mv mesh.yml config
mv keystore.jceks config
----
=====================================================================

[CAUTION]
=====================================================================
Manual Change: The graph database folder needs to be moved. Please create the `storage` subfolder and move the existing data into that folder.

[source,bash]
----
mkdir -p data/graphdb/storage
mv data/graphdb/* data/graphdb/storage/
----
=====================================================================

icon:plus[] REST: The `/api/v1/admin/consistency/check` endpoint has been added. The endpoint can be used to verify the database integrity.

icon:check[] Core: Fixed missing OrientDB roles and users for some older graph databases. Some graph databases did not create the needed OrientDB user and roles. These roles and users are needed for the OrientDB server and are different from Gentics Mesh users and roles.

icon:check[] REST: Invalid date strings were not correctly handled. An error will now be thrown if a date string can't be parsed.

icon:check[] REST: The delete handling has been updated.
                   It is now possible to specify the `?recursive=true` parameter to recursively delete nodes.
                   By default `?recursive=false` will be used. Deleting a node which contains children will thus cause an error.
                   The behaviour of node language deletion has been updated as well. Deleting the last language of a node will also remove this node. This removal will again fail if no `?recursive=true` query parameter has been added.

== 0.9.28 (28.08.2017)

icon:check[] Core: The permission check system has been updated. The elements which have only `readPublished` permission can now also be read if the user has only `read` permission. The `read` permission automatically also grants `readPublished`.

icon:check[] REST: The endpoint `/api/v1/{projectName}/nodes/{nodeUuid}/binary/{fieldName}` did not correctly handle the read published nodes permission. This has been fixed now. link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh/issues/111[#111]

== 0.9.27 (23.08.2017)

icon:plus[] GraphQL: It is now possible to retrieve the unfiltered result count. This count is directly loaded from the search provider and may not match up with the exact filtered count.
            The advantage of this value is that it can be retrieved very fast.

icon:plus[] Java REST Client: The client now also supports encrypted connections.

icon:check[] REST: Invalid date were not correctly handled. An error will now be thrown if a date string can't be parsed.

icon:check[] GraphQL: Various errors which occurred when loading a schema of a node via GraphQL have been fixed now.

icon:check[] Migration: The error handling within the schema migration code has been improved.

icon:plus[] GraphQL: It is now possible to load the schema version of a node using the ```schema``` field.

icon:check[] Versioning: Older Gentics Mesh instances (>0.8.x) were lacking some draft information. This information has been added now.

== 0.9.20 (21.07.2017)

icon:plus[] Auth: Support for anonymous access has been added to mesh. Requests which do not provide a `mesh.token` will automatically try to use the `anonymous` user. This user is identified by `username` and the thus no anonymous access support is provided if the user can't be located.

icon:plus[] GraphQL: It is now possible to retrieve the path for a content using the `path` field. The `Node.languagePaths` has been removed in favour of this new field.

icon:plus[] Auth: It is now possible to issue API tokens via the `GET /api/v1/users/:userUuid/token` endpoint. API tokens do not expire and work in conjunction with the regular JWT authentication mechanism. These tokens should only be used when SSL is enabled. The `DELETE /api/v1/users/:userUuid/token` endpoint can be used to revoke the issued API token. Only one API token is supported for one user. Generating a new API token will invalidate the previously issued token.

icon:check[] GraphQL: An error was fixed which occurred when loading a node using a bogus uuid.

icon:check[] Core: Migration errors will no longer cause a migration to be aborted. The migration will continue and log the errors. An incomplete migration can be resumed later on.

icon:check[] Core: Fixed node migration search index handling. Previous migrations did not correctly update the index. A automatic reindex will be invoked during startup.

== 0.9.5 (13.04.2017)

[quote]
____
This version of Gentics Mesh introduces versioning of contents. A detailed description of the versioning feature can be found in our https://getmesh.io/docs/beta/index.html[Documentation].

Important changes summary:

* Node update request must now include the version information
* The query parameter `?version=published` must be used to load published nodes. Otherwise the node will not be found because the default version scope is __draft__.
* Two additional permissions for nodes have been added: __publish__, __readpublished__

Existing databases will automatically be migrated during the first setup.
