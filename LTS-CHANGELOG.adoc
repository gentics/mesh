= Gentics Mesh LTS Changelog

The LTS changelog lists releases which are only accessible via a commercial subscription.
All fixes and changes in LTS releases will be released the next minor release. Changes from LTS 1.4.x will be included in release 1.5.0.

[[v1.6.24]]
== 1.6.24 (TBD)

icon:check[] Search: When the ElasticSearch instance is not available, getting version information from the endpoint `/api/v1` failed with an internal
server error. This has been fixed, calling the endpoint `/api/v1` will not fail anymore, but will not contain the ElasticSearch version.

icon:check[] Rest: When a project with name "project" was deleted, calls to the endpoint `/projects` would cause 404 errors, until the Mesh instance was restarted.
This has been fixed now.

icon:check[] Java Rest Client: If requests to mesh fail with I/O errors (including timeouts), the thrown exception will now also contain the request method and URL.

icon:check[] Server: Liveness-Check script `live.sh` will now fail if the `mesh.live` file has not been changed since 20s (previously 60s)

[[v1.6.23]]
== 1.6.23 (11.11.2021)

icon:check[] OrientDB: The included OrientDB version has been updated to version `3.1.15`.

icon:check[] Cluster: When doing a rolling update in a cluster, a OConcurrentModificationException could occur during the startup, which could cause
subsequent errors. This has been fixed.

icon:plus[] Core: A periodic check for available disk space has been added. If not enough disk space is available, Gentics Mesh will be set to read-only to avoid corruption
of the storage due to a full disk. Additionally, the metrics `mesh_storage_disk_total` and `mesh_storage_disk_usable` have been added to monitoring.

icon:check[] Search: The indices for nodes of a schema, which contains fields of type "micronode" have a mapping for the fields in the allowed microschemas, but were not
changed, if the microschemas were changed. This caused subsequent errors while indexing or searching.
The naming of such indices have been changed to contain a hash over all allowed microschema versions and when a microschema is changed, a new index will be created now.
This update will automatically drop and recreate all existing indices for schemas containing fields of type "micronode".

icon:plus[] AWS S3: Now the Cross-Origin Request Settings parameters of a S3 connection can be configured. By default the allowed headers/origins are set to `*`, the allowed methods are set to `"GET", "PUT", "POST", "DELETE"`. Setting any of the CORS configuration to `null` prevents is to override the server's default configuration. Setting all the CORS configuration to null or empty value prevents the CORS config to be changed at all.

[[v1.6.22]]
== 1.6.22 (19.10.2021)

icon:check[] Server: when a schema was updated with a new field with elastic search properties, these were ignored. This has been fixed now.

icon:check[] Search: If ElasticSearch indices, which were originally created by Mesh were dropped, they would probably be re-created with the default mapping when Mesh
stored a document in the index. This could cause the index to be not completely filled and also the mapping to be incorrect, so that search queries would fail to find
documents. In order to detect and repair such situations, a periodic check has been added to Mesh, which will check existence and correctness of all required ElasticSearch
indices. Missing indices will be created and incorrect indices will be dropped and re-created. Afterwards a full sync for the affected indices will be triggered. The check
period can be configured with the new configuration setting `search.indexCheckInterval`, which defaults to 60_000 milliseconds. Setting the interval to 0 will disable the
periodic check (not recommended).

icon:plus[] Search: The index maintenance endpoints `/api/v1/search/sync` and `/api/v1/search/clear` have been extended with the query parameter `index`, which can be used
to restrict the synchronized/cleared indices by a regular expression.

icon:check[] Search: The index maintenance actions triggered via `/api/v1/search/sync` and `/api/v1/search/clear` will now be redirected to the current master instance,
if the cluster coordinator is used.

icon:check[] Core: The included Mesh UI has been updated to version `1.3.1`, containing the language-related improvements and minor bugfixes.

[[v1.6.21]]
== 1.6.21 (12.10.2021)

icon:check[] Search: When a full synchronization of the search indices was triggered, language specific indices were unnecessarily removed first. This has been changed,
language specific indices will now be treated like all other indices during a full synchronization.

icon:check[] Core: When performing an update for role permissions, an event was published even if the update actually did not change anything. A check has been added to
only publish the event if permissions are actually changed.

icon:check[] Core: When eventbus messages where published during execution of a job (e.g. a node migration), the events were not published and handled immediately,
but were queued in memory and eventually published after the job execution. This caused high memory consumption during a node migration and also the elasticsearch
indexing of migrated nodes to be delayed until after all nodes had been migrated. Execution of the jobs has been changed now, so that events will be published
immediately to fix those issues.

icon:check[] Core: The overall memory consumption during a migration job has been reduced.

icon:check[] Clustering: Due to a bug in the vert.x eventbus system, elasticsearch sync operations were not only performed in the Mesh instance, were the
causing data change actually happened, but on all Mesh instances, which caused unnecessary high load on the elasticsearch. This has been fixed with a workaround.

icon:check[] Core: When deleting old versions of nodes, the related binaries were not deleted from the disk. This has been fixed now. Credits to [kdima001](https://github.com/kdima001).

icon:check[] Core: When an OrientDB transaction repeatedly fails and runs into the retry limit, the original cause will now also be logged.

icon:check[] Server: When an OutOfMemory was caught or one of the plugins (permanently) failed to initialize, mesh was still considered to be live. This has been fixed now.

icon:check[] Clustering: When doing an offline update of Mesh in a cluster, the first instance of the cluster could not be started with the new Mesh version, because
the new version should be written into OrientDB, which failed due to write quorum not reached. The initialization procedure has been changed now, so that executing the
changelog and storing the Mesh version and DB revision will now only be started after the write quorum has been reached.

icon:check[] Server: added a health/writable monitoring and REST endpoint to check whether mesh is in a writable state (e.g. the topology lock is not hold).

[[v1.6.20]]
== 1.6.20 (23.09.2021)

icon:check[] Server: Mesh will now create a file `mesh.live` and touch it every 10 seconds as long as the instance is considered live. If an OutOfMemory is caught or one
of the plugins (permanently) fails to initialize, mesh is considered no longer live and the file will not be touched any more.

icon:check[] Server: The readiness probe will now also check the status of the local OrientDB storage. A mesh instance will only be considered "ready" if the local OrientDB storage is "ONLINE".

icon:check[] GraphQL: The `wait` parameter will now only wait for elasticsearch to be ready when a `query` option in `nodes` is actively used.
Previously it would wait for elasticsearch even if it wasn't needed.

[[v1.6.19]]
== 1.6.19 (22.09.2021)

icon:check[] Clustering: When recovering from a split-brain situation, the topology lock (which was raised, because nodes rejoined the cluster)
was not always removed. This has been fixed, and some info log about the reason for the topology lock has been added.

[[v1.6.18]]
== 1.6.18 (26.08.2021)

icon:check[] Core: The included Mesh UI has been updated to version `1.3.0`, containing the stability improvements, as well as the new feature of the node status (draft/updated/published/archived etc) filtering.

[[v1.6.17]]
== 1.6.17 (18.08.2021)

icon:check[] Clustering: The high level changelog system has been extended to allow for specific changes to be executed in cluster mode.

[[v1.6.16]]
== 1.6.16 (10.08.2021)

icon:check[] Core: A bug preventing the string schema field restrictions from being cleared, has been fixed.

== 1.6.15 (21.06.2021)

icon:check[] Core: The included Hazelcast-Kubernetes library has been updated to version `1.5.6`, containing a DNS resolving fix.

[[v1.6.14]]
== 1.6.14 (17.06.2021)

icon:check[] AWS S3: A bug preventing the new image data from being stored into an existing `s3binary` container, has been fixed.
icon:check[] AWS S3: An inability of changing permissions for the schema with an S3 field has been fixed.

[[v1.6.13]]
== 1.6.13 (03.06.2021)

icon:plus[] Core: Added support for storing/referencing the binary data at Amazon Web Services S3 container.

[[v1.6.12]]
== 1.6.12 (02.06.2021)

icon:plus[] Clustering: The `cluster.topologyChangeReadOnly` setting and `MESH_CLUSTER_TOPOLOGY_CHANGE_READONLY` environment setting have been added. By enabling this flag, Mesh will be automatically set in `readOnly` mode,
when the cluster topology changes, which will let reading requests pass and writing requests fail (immediately), instead of blocking all requests, which happens when the `cluster.topologyLockTimeout` is set to a positive value.

icon:check[] Plugins: If plugin initialization fails due to topology changes (e.g. the OrientDB needs to be synchronized from another node), the plugin will be set to
status FAILED_RETRY and initialization will be retried as soon as OrientDB becomes available again.

icon:plus[] Clustering: The timeout for waiting to join the cluster (which includes the time for synchronizing the graphdb storage), which was hardcoded to 500_000 milliseconds, can now be configured with the setting `storage.clusterJoinTimeout` or the environment variable `MESH_GRAPH_CLUSTER_JOIN_TIMEOUT`.

[[v1.6.11]]
== 1.6.11 (12.05.2021)

icon:check[] OrientDB: The included OrientDB version has been updated to version `3.1.11`.

[[v1.6.10]]

icon:check[] Upload: More user-friendly message + HTTP 400 error on an attempt to upload an empty file.

icon:check[] OrientDB: The included OrientDB version has been updated to version `3.1.10`.

icon:check[] Upload: The document processing library _tika_ has been updated to version `1.26` to fix the PDF parser failing on files with some Adobe fonts.

[[v1.6.7]]
== 1.6.7 (20.11.2020)

icon:check[] Jobs: A race condition within the job processing mechanism has been fixed. In some cases newly created jobs would not be automatically invoked. This has been fixed now.

icon:check[] Search: Fixed potential `NullPointerException` that could occur during search index synchronization.

[[v1.6.6]]
== 1.6.6 (11.11.2020)

icon:plus[] GraphQL: The `breadcrumb` field now accepts the `lang` parameter which will be used for additional fallback languages.

[[v1.6.5]]
== 1.6.5 (04.11.2020)

== 1.6.3 (21.10.2020)

icon:check[] OrientDB: The included OrientDB version has been updated to version `3.1.3`.

icon:check[] Clustering: Internal caches will now be cleared when cluster topology changes occur.

icon:plus[] Backup: The `?consistencyCheck` query parameter was added to the `/api/v2/admin/backup` endpoint. When set to true it will run the consistency check before invoking the backup. The call will fail when inconsistencies were detected.

icon:check[] Clustering: An additional check has been added which will prevent nodes from joining a cluster which contains an outdated database. The `-initCluster` flag needs to be used for a single instance to migrate the cluster. This is done to prevent concurrency issues during changelog execution and cluster formation.

icon:check[] Tests: The path handling for the `MeshContainer` test container class has been updated. Container data will now be placed in the `target/mesh-containers` folder.

[[v1.6.2]]
== 1.6.2 (06.10.2020)

icon:check[] Additional log output and checks have been added to the auth plugin mapping code. This fix also addresses the `Null keys are not supported` error which was thrown when handling mappings which provide no group and role names. link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh/issues/1138[#1138]

icon:check[] OrientDB: The included OrientDB version has been updated to version `3.0.34`.

icon:check[] Rest: The webroot cache error handling has been improved.


[[v1.6.1]]
== 1.6.1 (24.09.2020)

icon:plus[] Search: The memory footprint of the differential sync mechanism has been reduced. The sync operations will now be split into buckets. The size of the buckets can be influenced via the `search.syncBatchSize` setting.

CAUTION: The new sync mechanism requires a reindex of all documents. The Elasticsearch indices will be automatically cleared and re-synced during the first startup of this version.

icon:check[] Core: Fixed a bug that which prevented to update a node reference of a user if the user already had one set. link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh/issues/1114[#1114]

icon:plus[] Core: It is now possible to disable extracting of metadata or content from binaries on a per-field basis. See link:{{< relref "building-blocks.asciidoc" >}}#_schema_field_types[schema field types documentation] for more information.

icon:check[] Core: Fixed a bug that which prevented to update a node reference of a user if the user already had one set. link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh/issues/1114[#1114]

[[v1.4.13]]
== 1.4.13 (26.08.2020)

icon:plus[] Plugins: The default plugin timeout has been increased from 15 seconds to two minutes.

icon:plus[] Monitoring: The readiness probe will now also check for plugin status. Failed plugin deployments will let the readiness probe fail.

[[v1.4.12]]
== 1.4.12 (17.07.2020)

icon:check[] Clustering: The link:{{< relref "clustering.asciidoc" >}}#_cluster_coordination[cluster coordinator] will now detect changes caused by the OAuth token mapping and will redirect the request if necessary. Thus this change allows the use of the `CUD` mode when using request coordination in combination with authentication plugins.

icon:plus[] Clustering: When using the cluster coordinator, forwarded requests will now contain the link:{{< relref "image-manipulation.asciidoc" >}}#_headers[`X-Mesh-Forwarded-From` header].

[[v1.4.11]]
== 1.4.11 (23.06.2020)

icon:check[] Plugins: A potential resource leak could cause thread exhaustion when using new REST Clients for each request. This has been fixed now.

[[v1.4.10]]
== 1.4.10 (12.05.2020)

icon:check[] Plugins: Fixed an error which was triggered when trying to un-deploy a not yet deployed plugin.

icon:check[] Plugins: Fixed a bug in the plugin registration process in which plugin deployments would fail due to timeouts in clustered environments.

[[v1.4.9]]
== 1.4.9 (07.05.2020)

icon:plus[] Plugins: The plugin registration process was changed. Plugins will now no longer be directly registered when deployed. Instead the plugins will remain in a pre-registration status util Gentics Mesh is able to deploy them. This is especially useful when running plugins in clustered mode. Plugins will only be registered once the write quorum has been reached. Additionally the plugin deployment process will now utilize a lock in clustered mode to prevent concurrent deployments of plugins. The plugin status was added to the plugin endpoint response.

icon:check[] Clustering: The write lock was removed from the `DELETE /api/v2/admin/plugins/:id` and `POST /api/v2/admin/plugins` endpoints to prevent potential deadlocks.

[[v1.3.4]]
== 1.3.4 (11.05.2020)

CAUTION: Microschema migrations since version 1.2.0 are very likely to cause a loss of data in nodes that contain micronodes of the migrated schema. This bug has been fixed in this version. At the first start with this version or higher, Gentics Mesh will try to restore affected nodes in projects with a single branch. However, because some data cannot be restored, we advise to restore a backup of a moment before the microschema migration, if possible. We apologize for the inconvenience.
