# Gentics Mesh - MDM Common

The `mdm/common` module contains already cleaned code which does not reference any database-specific code.
The goal of this module is to be a placeholder container for `/common` and `/core` code which has only ORM dependency. 
The `/common` module contains both ORM-and database-agnostic code.
