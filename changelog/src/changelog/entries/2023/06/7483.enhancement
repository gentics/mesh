GraphQL: Support of database level filtering/sorting has been added. New `sort` parameter in added for structured sorting, forcing the usage of DB filtering. New GraphQL parameter `nativeFilter` 
is added to the selected entity lookup methods, with options `NEVER` (old filtering is forced), `ALWAYS` (DB filtering is forced), `IF_POSSIBLE` (if the requested filter is supported by a DB, DB filtering is used, otherwise filtering is fallen back to the old filter mechanism). 
Please note that not all the currently existing filters are supported by the DB.
