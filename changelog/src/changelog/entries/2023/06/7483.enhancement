GraphQL: Support of database level filtering/sorting has been added. New sort parameter in added for structured sorting, forcing the usage of DB filtering. New GraphQL parameter nativeFilter is added to the selected entity lookup methods, with options NEVER (old filtering is forced), ALWAYS (DB filtering is forced), IF_POSSIBLE (if the requested filter is supported by a DB, DB filtering is used, otherwise filtering is fallen back to the old filter mechanism). Please note that not all the currently existing filters are supported by the DB.
