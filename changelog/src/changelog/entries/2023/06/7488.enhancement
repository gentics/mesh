Adds asynchronous checks for uploaded binaries. When the new property `binaryCheckUrl` is set for a binary field in a schema, a request for checking the binary will be sent to that URL. The service is expected to send a request to the callback endpoint for that binary to set the check status to either ACCEPTED or DENIED (status for binaries with pending checks is POSTPONED). Requests for binaries with a check status other than ACCEPTED will result in a 404 response.
