Core: The new configuration option `vertxOptions.orderedBlockingHandlers` allows to change the behaviour of concurrent handling of "long running" requests
(requests that modify data or GraphQL requests). If the option is set to `true` (default value) such requests will be run in order (per http verticle) and never concurrently.
As a consequence, it may happen that e.g. GraphQL requests are queued for some time if some other requests are currently handled.
If the option is set to `false`, blocking requests will only be queued, if all threads of the worker pool are currently busy.
