# Hazelcast 3 Cluster Manager

Fork of [Vert.x Hazelcast](https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-hazelcast) implementing Vert.x 4 Cluster SPI using Hazelcast 3.

This was created since Vert.x Hazelcast cluster manager supports only Hazelcast 4, and OrientDB doesn't support
Hazelcast 4 at the moment of writing.
