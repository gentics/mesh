| The resolve links parameter can be set to either _short_, _medium_ or _full_. Stored mesh links will automatically be resolved and replaced by the resolved webroot link. With the parameter set the _path_ property as well as the _languagesPath_ property (for available language variants) will be included in the response. Gentics Mesh links in any HTML-typed field will automatically be resolved and replaced by the resolved WebRoot path. No resolving occurs if no link has been specified.
