title: Image Manipulation

include::content/docs/variables.adoc-include[]

Images can be resized and/or cropped by appending the <<imagemanipulationparams,image manipulation query parameters>> on the relevant API endpoints.
The following image formats are supported: `png`, `jpg`, `bmp` and `gif`

== Resize

=== Using UUID

Endpoint: ```{apiLatest}/:projectName/nodes/:uuid/binary/:fieldname?w=220```

.Try the example

=== Using Path

Images can be loaded similar to regular contents. It is also possible to load them using the WebRoot path.

TIP: By Path: https://demo.getmesh.io{apiLatest}/demo/webroot/images/ford-gt.jpg?h=300

=== Resizing Options

When loading an image with resizing parameters you can provide either the desired width by appending `w=:width` or the desired height by appending by appending `h=:height`. 

==== Smart resizing and Cropping
It also possible to provide both dimensions. Note that in this case Mesh potentially crops your image to fit the desired dimensions. This happens when the aspect ratio of the source image is different from the requested dimensions. In these cases Mesh will crop _either_ pixels at the top and bottom or left and right.

NOTE: Providing no resize parameter yields the same result as providing `resize=smart`

Should you not want to crop the image but still have Mesh transform the image to fit the requested width and height you also have other options:

==== Proportional resizing
To make sure the requested image fits inside the provided dimensions you can provide the paramater `resize=prop`. This scales the image _proportionally_ - but the resulting image can potentially hava a different aspect ratio than the requested dimensions. In practice the resulting image will often only have either the correct width or the correct height - but it will fit the provided 'bounding rectangle'.

==== Forced resizing
You can use the resizing option `resize=force` to request the source image with exactly the requested width and height and without cropping.
Note that using the force-resizing mode can potentially lead to non-proportional resizing and thus potentially distort your image.

.When providing width and height Mesh resizes and crops the image to the desired format. Cropping happens only if necessary and only in one dimension.

.When adding the resize parameter `prop` the image gets scaled proportionally to fit the dimensions.

.When adding the resize parameter `force` the image gets distorted to fit the dimensions

== Crop

You can also selectively extract a certain portion of your image by providing a cropping rectangle with the paramater `rect=:startPositionXCoordinate,:startPositionYCoordinate,:WidthOfRectangle,:HeightOfRectangle&crop=rect`.

NOTE: It is mandatory to specify all four crop parameters when cropping an image.

.Let's say we want to highlight the motorcycle behind the car. We could do this by cropping everything else.
image::https://demo.getmesh.io{apiLatest}/demo/webroot/images/ford-gt.jpg?rect=520,70,280,160&crop=rect[Cropped image]

TIP: Cropping can also be combined with resizing.

== Placeholders

NOTE: You can use the `dominantColor`, `width` and `height` properties of the image fields to generate colored placeholder areas for your images. The `dominantColor` of the image will  automatically be computed for each uploaded image.

It is also possible to use the image manipulation in combination with the WebRoot endpoint.

Endpoint: ```{apiLatest}/:projectName/webroot/:path?rect=10,100,800,400&crop=rect```

.Try the example

== Focal Point

Responsive designs often suggest the usage of https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images[srcset images for responsive images].
Sometimes those designs require image sizes which lead to cropped images. This could result in images which seem chopped off at the worst possible place or images which miss the important part.

You can however use the focal point feature in order to influence how the image should be cropped. 
Gentics Mesh will use the focal point information when cropping the image so that the focused area will remain in the image.

First you need to specify a focal point along with your image.
You can store the focal point information within the binary field of your image or use the `fpx` and the `fpy` query parameters when loading the image.
You can also use these parameters to override the stored focal point.

The width and height information via `w` and `h` parameter are also needed when loading the image. 
Otherwise Gentics Mesh can't tell which area of the image needs to be cropped. 

Finally the `fpdebug` parameter can be used to visualize the focal point. This is useful when testing designs and resize parameters.

.Try the example
[TIP]
https://demo.getmesh.io{apiLatest}/demo/webroot/images/ford-gt.jpg?fpx=0.5&fpy=0.4&w=800&h=600&crop=fp&fpdebug=true

In some cases you may want to show just a single area of the image. In this case you can use the `fpz` zoom parameter to zoom to the focal point area.

.Try the example
[TIP]
https://demo.getmesh.io{apiLatest}/demo/webroot/images/ford-gt.jpg?fpx=0.5&fpy=0.35&fpz=3.0&w=800&h=600&crop=fp&fpdebug=true

It is also possible to store focal point information along with the binary field. This way you can set the focal point once and omit it within the image request. 
In those cases it is not needed to specify the `fpx` and `fpy` parameter. Gentics Mesh will automatically load the missing parameter from the binary field if possible.

.Try the example
[TIP]
https://demo.getmesh.io{apiLatest}/demo/webroot/images/ford-gt.jpg?fpz=1.2&w=800&h=600&crop=fp&fpdebug=true


=== Responsive Design

You can use the focal point feature to mark the point of interest in your images. That information can be used to generate different size sets of your images. Different image sizes may be required by your responsive design. The focal point will be used by Gentics Mesh to crop the image in the desired way.

image::https://demo.getmesh.io{apiLatest}/demo/nodes/df8beb3922c94ea28beb3922c94ea2f6/binary/image?w=200&h=200&crop=fp&fpdebug=true&version=1.0[Image with FP]

image::https://demo.getmesh.io{apiLatest}/demo/nodes/df8beb3922c94ea28beb3922c94ea2f6/binary/image?w=100&h=300&crop=fp&fpdebug=true&version=1.0[Image with FP]

=== Updating Focalpoint

The focal point can be updated by updating the node which contains the binary field.

.Example Request:
[source,bash]
----
POST {apiLatest}/demo/nodes/df8beb3922c94ea28beb3922c94ea2f6

{
  "language": "en",
	"version": "draft",
  "fields": {
    "image": {
      "focalPoint": {
        "x": 0.9,
        "y": 0.7
      }
    }
  }
}
----

Alternatively the focal can also be set when transforming the binary field.

*Example Request:*
[source,bash]
----
POST {apiLatest}/demo/nodes/df8beb3922c94ea28beb3922c94ea2f6/binaryTransform/image

{
  "version" : "1.0",
  "language" : "en",
  "width" : 300,
  "focalPoint": {
    "x": 0.2,
    "y": 0.4
  }
}
----


== Transform and Update an Image

Gentics Mesh also allows you to transform (i.e, crop and/or resize) and overwrite an image in a single step. 
The image manipulation parameters then are part of the request body. 
This will effectively override the currently stored image with the image of the resulting operation.

Endpoint: ```POST {apiLatest}/:projectName/nodes/:uuid/binaryTransform/:fieldname```

*Example Request:*
[source,bash]
----
POST {apiLatest}/demo/nodes/df8beb3922c94ea28beb3922c94ea2f6/binaryTransform/image

{
  "version" : "1.0",
  "language" : "en",
  "width" : 300
}
