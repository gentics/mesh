== Intro

In this guide you will learn how to use Gentics Mesh in combination with https://gohugo.io/[Hugo].

The site we are building is very basic and only consists of three different views which form a vehicle inventory.

The *welcome page* contains just a basic intro text and navigation. The *category overview* pages display lists entries of the category. The last page is the *vehicle detail page* which shows detailed information about the selected vehicle in the inventory.

== Building Blocks / Domain Model

In our site  we use a few different data elements.

Each `Vehicle` has a `name`, `description`, `SKU`, `price`, `weight`, `stockLevel` and `image` field. Each `Category` with a `name` field can list multiple `Vehicles`.

== Step 1 - Content

Next we will add our content to Gentics Mesh. For this we need to create a new *project*, link the created *schemas* to it. Finally we create some *contents*.

=== Project

Open the admin menu and create a new project called `demo`.

The previously created schemas `category`,`vehicle`, `vehicleImage` must be linked to the project.

=== Content

Close the admin area and open the Demo project.

==== Images folder

Create a new folder called `images`.

==== Aircrafts category

Next we create the `Aircrafts` category node. Make sure to use the `category` schema type.

==== Space Shuttle image

Open the `Images` folder and create a new `VehicleImage` node. You can link:../sts.jpg[download the space shuttle image].

image:../sts-vehicleimage.png[STS VehicleImage, role="img-responsive"]

==== Space Shuttle vehicle

Now it is time to create our vehicle. Open the Aircraft category and create a new `vehicle` node.

=== Permissions

Before we can read our data via GraphQL we need to assign the read permission to the newly created project. We need to apply the read permission *recusively* so that it will be applied to all created nodes. Otherwise we would need to deal with authentication in our frontend app. 

By default all unauthenticated requests to Gentics Mesh will fall back to use the `anonymous user` and the assigned `anonymous role`. This is very useful if you just want to serve data publicly without any authentication. This mechanism can of course be turned off in the `mesh.yml` file.

Additionally we also need to grant read permission on the `demo` project itself.

== Step 2 - Export

Now that we have setup or model and contents we can export these in a format that Hugo supports.

The https://github.com/gentics/mesh2hugo[mesh2hugo] will be used to load the contents from Gentics Mesh and export them to markdown files which contain the parameters of the content.


First download the latest version of the Mesh Hugo Exporter from https://github.com/gentics/mesh2hugo/releases

Now we can run the exporter which will connect to Gentics Mesh and load the contents.

`java -jar mesh2hugo-1.0.0.jar -c -p demo -url http://localhost:8080`

Alternatively you can also use the Gentics Mesh Demo server to load the contents.

`java -jar mesh2hugo-1.0.0.jar -c -p demo -url https://demo.getmesh.io`

The exported content markdown files show now look like this:

```

fields_description: "The Space Shuttle was a partially reusable low Earth orbital spacecraft system operated by the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)."
fields_vehicleImage: "/images/sts.jpg"
---
```

== Step 3 - Theme

The example project and theme can be found https://github.com/gentics/mesh2hugo/tree/master/example[in the mesh2hugo project].

The template for the single view renders the vehicle detail page. The mesh fields can be accessed via the `{{.Params.fields_name}}` parameters.

```
{{ define "content" }}
<div class="product-detail">
  <h1>{{.Params.fields_name}}</h1>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
      <form>
        <div class="form-group">
          <label htmlFor="name">Name</label>
          <input class="form-control" id="name" name="name" placeholder="Name" value={{.Params.fields_name}} />
        </div>

        <div class="form-group">
          <label htmlFor="description">Description</label>
          <div>{{ .Params.fields_description }}</div>
        </div>

        <div class="form-group">
          <label htmlFor="sku">SKU</label>
          <input class="form-control" id="sku" name="SKU" placeholder="SKU" value={{ .Params.fields_SKU }} type="number" />
        </div>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-sm-4 form-group">
            <label htmlFor="price">Price</label>
            <input class="form-control" id="price" min="0" name="price" step="0.01" type="number" value={{ .Params.fields_price}} />
          </div>
          <div class="col-sm-4 form-group">
            <label htmlFor="weight">Weight</label>
            <input class="form-control" id="weight" min="0" name="weight" type="number" value={{ int .Params.fields_weight}} />
          </div>
          <div class="col-sm-4 form-group">
            <label htmlFor="stocklevel">Stock Level</label>
            <input class="form-control" id="stocklevel" min="0" name="stocklevel" type="number" value={{ .Params.fields_stocklevel}} />
          </div>
        </div>
      </form>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6">
      <img class="img-thumbnail" src="{{.Params.fields_vehicleImage}}" alt="" />
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
{{end}}
```


== Step 4 - Rendering

Now we can run Hugo to render our page and access it via `http://localhost:1313`

```
hugo server
```

== Conclusion

You should now be able to create custom themes and load the content from Gentics Mesh. New vehicles can be added at any time. Invoking the exporter again will create the needed files and the preview server will reload the data.
