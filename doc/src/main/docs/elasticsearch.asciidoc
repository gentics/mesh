Elasticsearch is used in order to provide the main search functionality within Gentics Mesh.

When enabled it is possible to search for:

* link:#users[Users]
* link:#groups[Groups]
* link:#roles[Roles]
* link:#nodes[Nodes]
* link:#projects[Projects]
* link:#schemas[Schemas]
* link:#microschemas[Microschemas]
* link:#tags[Tags]
* link:#tagfamilies[TagFamilies]

Search queries can be executed via the dedicated search link:#endpoints[REST endpoints] or link:#_graphql[GraphQL].

== TL;DR

You can use link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.1/_introducing_the_query_language.html[Elasticsearch queries] to search for data.
Please note that the format of the documents which can be searched differs from the format which Gentics Mesh returns by the REST API. 
This difference will affect your queries.

== Integration details

=== Data format

NOTE:  The JSON format of stored documents within the Elasticsearch differ from the JSON format that is returned via regular Gentics Mesh endpoints.
Thus it is important to know the Elasticsearch document format when building an Elasticsearch query.

=== Permission handling

Internally Gentics Mesh will check which roles of the user match up with the needed roles of the documents and thus only return elements which are visible by the user.
This is done by nesting the input query inside of an outer boolean query which includes the needed filter terms.

=== Limitations

NOTE: It is not possible to search for specific individual versions. Instead only published and draft versions per project branch are stored in the search index.

NOTE: The stored documents within the Elasticsearch indices do not contain all properties which are otherwise available via REST. 
Only directly accessible values which have minimal dependencies to other elements are stored in order to keep the update effort manageable.

NOTE: Unlike Mesh, Elasticsearch does not allow an unbounded page size in the search result. The default value for the `perPage` parameter is `10`.

== Configuration

The Elasticsearch connection can be configured within the `mesh.yml` configuration file.

|======

=== Dedicated Elasticsearch

It is recommended to use a dedicated Elasticsearch server. You can disable the embedded Elasticsearch server via by setting `search.startEmbedded` to false. Your `search.url` parameter must point to the Elasticsearch installation that you want to use.

TIP: You can also use link:{{< relref "administration-guide.asciidoc" >}}#_environment_variables[environment variables] to configure Gentics Mesh and change these settings.

=== Embedded Elasticsearch

Gentics Mesh will setup and start the Elasticsearch server if the `search.startEmbedded` property is set to true.
The server installation will be placed in the current working directory and started.
A watchdog will continuously check the process and restart it when a crash has been detected.

WARNING: Support for embedded Elasticsearch will be dropped in the future.

=== Disabling search

It is also possible to completely turn off the search support by setting the `search.startEmbedded` property to false and the `search.url` property to null.

NOTE: The Gentics Mesh UI currently requires the Elasticsearch support to function correctly. 

== Compatibility

We currently run and test against Elasticsearch version 6.1.2. Other versions have not yet been tested.

[[endpoints]]
== REST endpoints

Search requests are handled by the ```{apiLatest}/search``` or ```{apiLatest}/:projectName/search``` endpoints.

If you want the search endpoints to wait until Elasticsearch has processed all pending changes to the index, you can set the query parameter `?wait=true`.
The default value can be configured in the link:{{< relref "administration-guide.asciidoc" >}}#_search_options[search options].

NOTE: If no query parameter and no configuration was provided, the wait parameter defaults to `true` to not break any existing implementations. In the future this will change to `false`.

== Examples / Queries

[[users]]
=== Users

Endpoint: ```{apiLatest}/search/users```

[source,json]
----
{
  "query": {
      "simple_query_string" : {
          "query": "myusername*",
          "fields": ["username.raw"],
          "default_operator": "and"
      }
  }
}
----

[[groups]]
=== Groups

Endpoint: ```{apiLatest}/search/groups```

[source,json]
----
{
  "query": {
      "simple_query_string" : {
          "query": "testgroup*",
          "fields": ["name.raw^5"],
          "default_operator": "and"
      }
  }
}
----

[[roles]]
=== Roles

Endpoint: ```{apiLatest}/search/roles```

[[nodes]]
=== Nodes

Endpoint: ```{apiLatest}/search/nodes```

==== Search nodes by schema name

Listed below is an example search query which can be posted to ```{apiLatest}/search/nodes``` in order to find all nodes across all projects which were created using the content schema.
The found nodes will be sorted ascending by creator.

[source,json]
----
{
  "sort" : {
     "created" : { "order" : "asc" }
  },
  "query":{
    "bool" : {
      "must" : {
        "term" : { "schema.name" : "content" }
       }
    }
  }
}
----

==== Search nodes by micronode

*Search nodes by micronode field values*

Find all nodes which have a micronode list field (vcardlist) that contain at least one micronode which contains the two string fields (firstName, lastName) with the values ("Joe", "Doe"):

[source,json]
----
{
  "query": {
    "nested": {
      "path": "fields.vcardlist",
      "query": {
        "bool": {
          "must": [
            {
              "match": {
                "fields.vcardlist.fields.firstName": "Joe"
              }
            },
            {
              "match": {
                "fields.vcardlist.fields.lastName": "Doe"
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
----

==== Search tagged nodes

*Search nodes which are tagged 'Solar' and 'Blue'*

The tags field is a nested field and thus a nested query must be used to match the two tags. Please note that you need to use `match_phrase` because you want to match the whole tag name. Using `match` would cause elasticsearch to match any of trigram found within the tag name value. 

[source,json]
----
{
  "query": {
    "nested": {
      "path": "tags",
      "query": {
        "bool": {
          "must": [
            {
              "match_phrase": {
                "tags.name": "Solar"
              }
            },
            {
              "match_phrase": {
                "tags.name": "Blue"
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
----

*Search nodes which have been tagged with 'Diesel' for tagFamily 'Fuels':*

[source,json]
----
{
    "query": {
        "nested": {
            "ignore_unmapped": "true",
            "path": "tagFamilies.Fuels.tags",
            "query": {
                "match": {
                    "tagFamilies.Fuels.tags.name": "Diesel"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
----


NOTE: The `"ignore_unmapped": "true"` will suppress errors which may be returned due to missing paths. This is useful when invoking `/rawSearch` requests which will directly return the Elasticsearch response. This response would otherwise be cluttered with a lot of errors due to missing path. This can be omitted for these kinds of searches.


==== Search nodes by geolocation of images

*Search images which were taken in specific areas*

GPS information from images will automatically be extracted and added to the search index. It is possible to run a link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/geo-queries.html[geo search] to locate images within a specific area.

[source,json]
----
{
    "query": {
        "bool" : {
            "must" : {
                "match_all" : {}
            },
            "filter" : {
                "geo_bounding_box" : {
                    "fields.binary.metadata.location" : {
                        "top_left" : {
                            "lat" : 50.0,
                            "lon" : 10.0
                        },
                        "bottom_right" : {
                            "lat" : -40.0,
                            "lon" : 19.0
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
----



[[projects]]
=== Projects

Endpoint: ```{apiLatest}/search/projects```

[[tags]]
=== Tags

Endpoint: ```{apiLatest}/search/tags```

[source,json]
----
{
  "query": {
    "nested": {
      "path": "tags",
      "query": {
        "bool": {
          "must": {
            "match_phrase": {
              "tags.name": "Twinjet"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
----

[[tagfamilies]]
=== Tag Families

Endpoint: ```{apiLatest}/search/tagFamilies```


[source,json]
----
{
  "query": {
    "nested": {
      "path": "tagFamilies.colors.tags",
      "query": {
        "match": {
          "tagFamilies.colors.tags.name": "red"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
----

[[schemas]]
=== Schemas

Endpoint: ```{apiLatest}/search/schemas```

[[microschemas]]
=== Microschemas

Endpoint: ```{apiLatest}/search/microschemas```

=== Paging

The paging query parameters are `perPage` and `page` . It is important to note that ```page``` is 1-based and ```perPage``` can be set to ```0``` in order to just retrieve a count of elements.

=== Raw search

Additionally it is also possible to use the ```{apiLatest}/rawSearch``` or ```{apiLatest}/:projectName/rawSearch``` endpoints.

These endpoints will accept the same query but return a Elasticsearch multi search response instead of the typical Gentics Mesh list response.
This is useful if you want to use for example the Elasticsearch highlighing and aggregation features.
The endpoint will automatically select the needed indices and modify the query in order to add needed permission checks.

==== Index Synchronization

The ```POST {apiLatest}/search/sync``` endpoint can be used to invoke a manual sync of the search index.

NOTE: The index sync operation will automatically be invoked when Mesh is being started and a unclean shutdown has been detected.

You can also recreate all indices if needed via the ```POST {apiLatest}/search/clear``` endpoint.

NOTE: This operation will remove all indices which have been created by Mesh and rebuild them one at a time.

== Binary Search

Document uploads to Gentics Mesh will automatically be parsed and the containing text will be extracted. This information will also be added to the search index and thus it is possible to search for text within uploaded documents.

Currently uploads which have one of these mimetypes will be processed:

* application/pdf
* application/msword
* text/rtf
* application/vnd.ms-powerpoint
* application/vnd.oasis.opendocument.text
* text/plain
* application/rtf

Example binary field within document:

[source,json]
----
…
  "binaryField" : {
    "filename" : "mydoc.pdf",
    "sha512sum" : "16d3aeae9869d2915dda30866c2d7b77f50dc668daa3a49d2bc6eb6349cf6e895099349b7f8240174a788db967c87947b6a2fd41a353eec99a20358dfd4c9211",
    "mimeType" : "application/pdf",
    "filesize" : 200,
    "file" : {
      "content" : "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet"
    }
  }
…
----

== GraphQL

It is possible to nest Elasticsearch queries within the GraphQL query in order to filter elements.

See link:{{< relref "graphql.asciidoc" >}}#search[GraphQL examples].

== Document format

The following section contains document examples which are useful when creating queries.
Gentics Mesh transforms elements into these documents which then can be stored within Elasticsearch.

== Custom mappings / index settings

The index settings for nodes can be configured within the schema json. Additionally it is also possible to add extra mappings to fields.
This may be desired when if a field needs to be analyzed in a special way or a `keyword` field must be added.

An example for such Schema can be seen below. 
This schema contains additional tokenizer and analyzer which can be used to setup an index that is ready to be used for a full-text search which supports autocompletion and auto suggestion.

----

Custom mappings can currently only be specified for the following types:

* string fields
* html fields
* string list fields
* html list fields
* binary fields

NOTE: Index settings for other elements (e.g: Users, Roles etc) can currently not be configured.

== Binary Fields

You can add custom mappings to the `mimeType` and `file.content` field. The elasticsearch property needs to contain a custom mapping for each type.

Example:
[source,json]
----
{
  "displayField": "name",
  "segmentField": "binary",
  "container": false,
  "description": "Image schema",
  "name": "image",
  "fields": [
    {
      "name": "name",
      "label": "Name",
      "required": false,
      "type": "string"
    },
    {
      "name": "binary",
      "label": "Image",
      "required": false,
      "type": "binary",
      "elasticsearch": {
        "mimeType": {
          "raw": {
            "type": "keyword",
            "index": true
          }
        },
        "file.content": {
          "raw": {
            "type": "keyword",
            "index": true
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
