== Intro

Long-term support releases provide you with a stable and secure upgrade path for your Gentics Mesh projects.
New features can always reduce the stability of a product. This is why we decided to provide our customers with another option.
The Long-Term support releases will not contain new features. Only bugfixes and security updates will be included.

Fixes for LTS releases will automatically be included in the next public release of Gentics Mesh.

A link:/services/[Product Maintenance] subscription is required to access LTS releases.

== Support Length

The end-of-life date of each feature release is usually one year after its initial release date.
After that date, the software is no longer supported by Gentics.

== Maintenance and security updates

For every supported feature release, we regularly release hotfixes with the goal to:

* fix security vulnerabilities
* fix high-impact bugs (e.g., data loss)
* fix bugs with substantial benefit and low risk

We do not introduce new features with these releases.
