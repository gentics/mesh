= Security

This section will cover information about Gentics Mesh security related topics.

== API Tokens

API tokens can be generated via the `/api/v1/users/:uuid/token`.
These tokens should not be publicly exposed since they they are equivant to user credentials.
Tokens can be reset via the `/api/v1/users/:uuid/reset_token` endpoint.
This will invalidate any previously generated API token.

== Network Security

Gentics Mesh can provide various internal services which each utilize dedicated ports.
By default only the REST and GraphQL API on port *8080* will be exposed. 
The REST and GraphQL API is secured by the Gentics Mesh authentication mechanism.

IMPORTANT: Exposing this service would allow anyone to modify, read and delete any of the data within the search index. 
User passwords are not stored within this index.

NOTE: Search queries can be submitted via the `/api/v1/:project/search/:type` endpoints. These endpoints are secured by Gentics Mesh.

The *storage.startServer* setting can be used to start the OrientDB server on port 2424 and 2480. 
This server will automatically be started if the *cluster.enabled* setting is enabled. It is advised to not expose this service.

The *cluster.enabled* setting will startup the OrientDB server as described above. 
Additionally the Vert.x eventbus, ElasticSearch clustering and Hazelcast service will be started. 
All these services will open dedicated ports which will bind to the network which can be configured via the *cluster.networkHost* setting.

IMPORTANT: Do not expose the service ports which are listed in the link:clustering.html#_port_mapping[clustering] documentation to the internet.

== ElasticSearch

The Elasticsearch server will automatically open port *9200*. 
Keep in mind that this service should *never* be exposed publicly since it is not protected by any authentication mechanism.

== Database Security

User passwords are stored as link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt[bcrypt] hashes.
