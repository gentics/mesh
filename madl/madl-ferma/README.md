# Gentics Mesh - Ferma / MADL compatibility layer

This module contains code which aims to ease the transition from Ferma to MADL.

## Goals / Background

Once the transition has completed this module should be removed (this no longer is a primary goal).

## MDM

Nothing to do for MDM (MADL will still be used for OrientDB).
